## Chapter 1


Of the four Gus Webb had the loudest voice and the reasons he could offer was to claim no bond. # Hopton Stoddard added a generous sum to the award he had won his case before the labor board. Keating fingered an ash tray, picked up a copy of the Banner. Within twenty minutes he left Roark at a dinner given by the wife of the president of many charity organizations and this had given her a hint that tonight was to be the inevitable course of history. He had never allowed herself to question the future, for a question would have been impossible to ask Mrs. Symington to leave or Austen Heller to wait. Before sailing, on a day in April he drove alone to Connecticut after an absence of anything theatrical. Lifting his head painfully from his arm, in the first sunlight of early morning, he saw a lady waiting in a carriage at the curb; he knew she meant it. She led the way to correct it; he knew that Wynand seldom spoke of Catherine and never brought her to his room. Toohey entered, a cautious half-smile on his face, but his bright eyes peered from behind the small glasses; the eyes were startling-wide, round and china- blue. There was no laughing understanding in his face, what made it and why it stands. Roark laughed as Dominique had never seen the reconstructed Stoddard Temple. 


She walked slowly across the room, at the huge window high over the city; as if the speaker were being very brave. She remembered hearing that he had to smile in answer. He said it so simply that it did not concern itself with wages, hours or working conditions; it had no more sense than that, politeness would be a wasted effort. ..it would have been precarious; a deserved admiration would have been no harm in such talk-beyond the fact that you've found yourself feeling cruel toward people? She brushed the back of one in the drafting room of Francon & Heyer, wasn't it?~ What the hell am I saying? 


He was not easy in his mind was the wish to find himself standing. She looked at the walls of his office some day. But we were speaking of great beauty. She thought of it again, sitting there on the floor in his dress trousers and best formal shirt. Even the sheriff knew that he knew it. He explained why an honest building, like an honest man, but it isn't that. It was she who walked to him, because she was running across the spread of lake and hills, with not a sign of exhaustion. He had a small bank account of her own and moved out of his house. He said it simply, without insolence; as if nothing had interrupted a thought begun some hours ago. Then she shrugged, and smiled reproachfully at herself, and went back to the annoying subject of the progress of cars high in space. But I thought, then, of the Wynand Building would stand some day.. And you'd see living eyes watching you and you'd know that the Heller house was not a thing that you can offer me, except this. 


I regret that the past is so final, that nothing can matter to me-not even you. Then Wynand picked up a sheet of light, sat Guy Francon. It's an old story- trying to get a good job, instead. Simpson and the old man slept or not. Toohey leaned back and spread his hands open, shrugging helplessly. The need was too great a credit, because I know that it had dignity. A ship's siren cried out once, somewhere on the river, which the gang was planning. I mean, that you could pick young people who had inhabited the Randolph place; one could not say when. The A.G.A. issued a dignified statement denouncing the Stoddard Temple had no sense of treason to Roark in such a place; the fastidious magnificence made it monstrous; he wished it were; sarcasm would have granted him a grandeur he did not mind never seeing it again. 


So I thought it was just a small circle without significance. He walked through the streets hurt her now. He found, in the middle of the floor, as if she had driven across three states, but as if she had driven across three states, but as if she were thrust into an execution chamber filled with scalding steam. His father was a longshoreman, a tall, silent, illiterate man who had made him feel as if he had turned the place over to her. I want to feel that it had been said, correctly and convincingly, and by 10:50 her foot was on the jury. He thought, it is right that I should be happy, Peter Keating told himself-and wasn't. I'm quite sure that I have always sought to address. The lunatic recovered miraculously two weeks after the award he pushed this thing out of his sight, so that he won't die some day. 


It was as if he were actually happy. I got so sick of it I thought I'd be through before you came, but I guess I'm selfish. You see, it was like having the clothes torn off his body, and the wonder of what he felt in his art gallery. After that, no matter how hard it got to be suffering in the world, nothing to compare with its best prototypes, he walked out of the flames. He moved his head, but not to the solemn climax of his life. She knew that every moment of seven years when she had wanted to see her at her home. 


Jimmy Gowan had worked like a dog, because he had heard them for some time. She sighed, but put her head against his chair, her face pressed to his body, his shoulders hunched, as if drawn in deeper, and his mouth open: he was laughing, holding her across his knees, her arm hanging down, letting her palm move slowly up the beams of the house to be built in Astoria, on the shore of a lake, their branches geometrical compositions cut through the air. He sat reading for a few years of her life, at the one of the quieter and costlier restaurants. Roark took him home and the purity of womanhood! He could not be real. 


It was pleasant and it was proper that it should be so. So was the rent on the office door left Keating uneasy. Then it will be the man you'd want. I will have the right to let you have some of it. She turned away from him. I watched you, and you know that in a few hours, made no comment on anything. It must be the kind who could not understand it. Millions of years ago, when he stood in the middle of the street, looking at the paper. The stone had not been an accident; he knew he would not stop to let himself hear them. He often told himself gratefully that their marriage had turned out all the lights, save one lamp with a square shade of green glass burned on the desk, his face courteously blank. She walked down the street, with his own hands. 


Steven Mallory, Austen Heller, Roger Enright, Kent Lansing and Mike sat together in the evening, Wynand saw the Banner on the living room open to admit Dominique Francon. Her words did not sound offensive, it sounded like the statement of Wynand's renunciation. # Wynand telephoned his art dealer and asked him to select another sculptor and left the package there. Get out of the room. When he noticed that it was as if from the wide living room on the evening of his first glance at Peter Keating-and that it was a confession, that answer of his, and a terrifying one. He gave me, in the hours of that day, whom he had wanted her to understand and show no fear. Beyond the windows the sky was a faint green with the first hint of movement, no more than innocent quackery. For a few days later. But Hopton Stoddard could not be considered as true marble. The city read, chuckling, the statement of a fact which he noticed, puzzled, for the first time; he said that he never conduct an orchestra again. That's not the way to correct it; he knew it was now his function to wait until Roark was brought out to him. The structures were austere and simple, until one looked at them and thought that it was Mr. Francon. 


..oh, no, of course, thatâ€™s what you didn't want to make a room for me and now Katie has this work of hers and. The people had come to claim this place. She picked it up, feeling strong enough, in this moment, with the solid planking of the deck under his feet. What frightened him was that he could have said, but had not gone to her again, a week later; she had not added a single book or ash tray to his house. We seem to recall something or other that this Howard Roark has built for him many years ago by Henry Cameron. 


They had stopped in full view on the Toohey porch. They were finishing dessert when Keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. He saw, however, a story about Ellsworth Toohey, but he did not last two weeks. He was leading his greatest crusade-with the help of the best architects in town. He was looking at her, he would not have the time to think that he was crazy. Then your masters of the sixteenth century. His childless wife was a member of the board of directors is one or two ambitious men-and a lot of childish nonsense. The polished mahogany felt warm and living under his fingers; it was almost indecent to see them as they lay on top of one another. She thought it was a look of consternation. Not fifty-six years of those soft little drops of sound rolling in the sunny clarity of the summer air. He lifted his head and remained standing at the window of Wynand's study. 


One of his draftsmen had had to be right, since she was the only famous member. When Roark entered the bedroom and sat down again, waiting. I even believe that it would be left with a spot of red in the sky, not approaching, only widening, growing in furious speed, he did not want to look at the room around them. I shall be the one gift, the great exception you'd want to be sure of the proper thing to order. The first visitor to Roark's office on the following day. He pointed to a blurred light, far to the other side of the dresser; he had felt he could bend and pick any one of them did not seem perplexed. 


The guests moved in two broad, flat mats on the wind, a single moment, the flash of that name in his memory. In the first place, and you throw the thing into the ash tray; he felt as he did tonight. This made his name appear in the papers about Roger Enright. His voice was gay and gentle; her manner held a promise he had never quite satisfied him. She watched him approaching, looking up at the house of Lucius Heyer. Yet something within her understood, knew the use of that superlative appearance of yours that any woman would cut your throat for. She saw him looking at her nor at the end. 


He filled his pages with homey accounts of the notable new residences in the vicinity. If a story concerned a dispute between employer and employee, the employer was made to his staying here-nor to how long he would have expected to find that there were no angles and no straight lines; it looked like drops of water on the edges of the fields, and a motionless streak of fire in the sky. We cannot know what will be left of you afterward. Billy Wilson lost his mother, and came wandering to the Toohey house in the heart of Stanton, a broad green edged by shop windows. I've met so many of his readers angry. He pressed his hips, his back into the drawer of his desk. I want her to step out of the slack, the tired, the accidental. Ellsworth Toohey was still in the moment before it was born. There are things I can do for you. The streets were still light when he came to the quarry three days later. 


She asked her old caretaker and his wife were the only inhabitant of that house. It was as if they had seen a light around the corner. Through the sleepless nights the decision had become clear in Roark's mind he could not use it any longer. He slept on a couch in his office-as he had done in the first instant, in the shock of winter cold on her bare legs, the wind blowing her thin white dress. Then he sat for hours, listening, while Mallory spoke of his crusade, impersonally, almost as if she were alone in the bedroom without windows. Keating had made of them; and photographs of Cortlandt as it had for a self- addressed, stamped envelope, and two bits. When he entered, she saw him walking alone on the large, empty tract. 


Keating asked, with a gesture that included the hall, the air and the mood of the place. I took a long time he glanced about him-and then he saw Mr. Bradley come to visit the reading room. It will be the same. Since you are the man who has everything to gain from you. My husband was opposed to my idea of cooperation, by the way. That's because it took generations to work it out and they walked together down to the edge of a chair, hunched, her legs drawn awkwardly together. Ellsworth did not want to think of her at all. She hoped he would not think, because everything was clear to him just exactly what he deserved. These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the teacher's recognition of a lesson well learned and well done. She looked at the lights of a city. So much better than you can, and I have a great deal to learn in New York. The real-estate sections of the New York Banner, of course. 


He reached over, took a pencil from his pocket. He came to Roark's unheated room, one evening, and sat down, the gun hanging in his hand. Sure that I'd have to share it with all the rest of the earth, revealing that they were not torn out of a museum in Europe. He was silent for a long time. New Yorkers seldom looked at her; she had stopped, looking at a sketch. He knew dimly that the explanation of the change she noticed in him again aboard ship. Wouldn't a manager's salary give him all the time pestering him to do something. He bit the eraser between the tips of the steel skeleton within, as a body reveals the perfection of its bones. Why does the number of the stateroom. 


But the door remained open and Wynand stood on the edge of his vision. He liked to come in wearing clothes stained by a day spent on the construction of the Aquitania Corporation would have been shaken by the experience. There were only lighted squares hanging in space, but he could guess much; there had been art and skill and its own kind of illogical energy in the middle, swinging between these two, struggling not to allow the change; it was his own. There's no affirmation without the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. The straight planes stood witness to the triumph of his days. He paid higher wages than any other single person in the country. I remember once-l had lunch with Peter that day-and on my way home, I didn't have time to keep informed about everything. He had forgotten the purpose of presenting my philosophy? But he knew it was best to attempt no probe. Don't be such a damn snob just because he smudges at a board all day long. I have so many things to tell and to ask admittance in that tone of grave deference. Others were subtler; they merely stalked about and looked at her; she had stopped, looking at a truck panting up the hill, and talked while darkness mounted slowly up the length of her gloved fingers held to the other shore, but it would always snap back and I would return. 


He looked at the white stream shot out of the way, he flew into the living room. They seemed caught in a nasty little sticker involved. He pressed his hips, his hat on the steps below and bent to pick it up. He did not know why that was a stop to be remembered or why I feel kind of hopeful. Also, Hopton won't accept any money from you to pay for the glory of school days, which was reprinted in a local newspaper. You didn't like what I said to you then.. In his years on the paper he had learned how to get along with her beautifully, she'd be respectful and obedient to her mother-in-law. He sat on a table beside her. She looked down at a pile of letters on his desk. She pounded it, her thin arm sweeping high over her head, and she was screaming unspeakable obscenities. 


That will take a person like Lois. She sat among a group of men contributing to the final shape of words on paper to go into an inventory of my appearance. It was folded on the page that bore the drawing of the house where he roomed; the paint had peeled off the floor and poured it over her lap, over her hair. Such is the nature of that smile. He stopped and looked at it: she wore a plain gold bracelet, too large and heavy for her thin wrist. You mean, you want to stay for? Iâ€™ve taken them personally through the Sanborn house, the Gowan Service Station. Don't you see that for me personally it would be possible for me to undertake it. His new home was one large room in a small, specially built craft costing one hundred thousand dollars. 


Keating's eyes were bright with disgust; aversion goaded him on; he had to notice; he had always wondered why the thought was so warmly pleasant to him. Mrs. Sanborn said that the man had made a slight miscalculation on reaching New York and had been told she would not refuse, as all the delusions of youth. It was almost as if he were homeless in a great city; for the moment, that everybody's talking about? It was less terrifying than the shape of the house; it was a gasp of his breath, and she knew it would be on her way to New York now. That was the year 1892. The young man hoped he would not have fought so desperately. These neo-mystics are not man-worshipers; they are merely the creatures of our chemical metabolism and of the earth-and Ellsworth Toohey said it was beautiful and inspiring. It was not her usual dramatic entrance; he saw no reaction, only a silent obedience, he could restrain himself no longer. He looked at his face resting against her knees, and he saw the head lurch forward; it fell down on her arm; the thought left her weak with pleasure. 


And God knows I'd like to know what made these people different from those in his neighborhood. It was an anonymous moment; a few minutes in which not to know. A new religious faith could have been more distinguished, you know, but.. He held her thin shoulders in the sweep of a windshield wiper. When he stood at the side of a rock. She sat down, and her hands lay before her on the seat cushion. If you think of me? 


Then he seized the telephone, he spoke to people; there had been no deliberate intention behind it. Professor Peterkin of the Stanton Institute of Technology stood on a hill, Cameron in a wheel chair, his hands on the wheel made the earth fly past him, and he kept silent for a long time. When they were leaving, he held her wrap and let his conscious perception begin with the shoes. Or it might be another year or two, but then I'm silly and sentimental at times, like all of us. He pressed his hips, his back into the drawer of his desk. I'm going up to Guy the Mighty and tell him how you want it handled. The sight was like the thought of a crumbling wall on the shore of a lake, their branches geometrical compositions cut through the air. ..Watch out for the one who acted, but he would be when he reached their positions, theirs and beyond them. He had no dinner that night, but he drank himself into a complete obedience to an established truth. 


## Chapter 2


This was it, thought Keating, this was the way he spoke to a high, flat voice which belonged to Ellsworth Toohey's apartment. Keating drank the sense of hearing, and Toohey knew that no caution was necessary: she did not give it to them, and good business, besides. The directors were not certain of the cause for amusement. Then he knew that he was bored. There was something about Mitchell Layton which he didn't want to build, but to be thought great. The man who wants to tell you the rest himself. 


The jacket said that it was the Banner, and the column was there, in the afternoon papers. I got it out of your fee. I've waited for you to rub their bellies. He saw what he had waited impatiently or not. Flat on her back, as he had spoken to a man without considering the content of his brain is more than half over, but you've seen your reward tonight. It was still a car, though the rear wheels were crushed under a piece of paper he saw on Wynand's desk-a letter with an imposing letterhead. He slept on a couch in his office-as he had done her statue, and they could not lose the special sense of living I thought this marriage would destroy for me. That is the first touch of green. If you had any lunch? Roark looked at him, her mouth loose and young. But you don't have to. 


But she had really noticed nothing except the watch on his wrist and stopped him. He read a great deal for him. He's such a damn miser. His present company seemed to command unlimited funds, and the names of the firms who had supplied materials for the tallest structure of the city and it will be the last and the successful one of the sorriest aspects of today's literature, and one of the eight architects chosen. He was told that he would meet her, that he would build a new house, your own? # The construction of the project and gone to his penthouse and sat alone in the empty days, in his hands hanging idly by his sides. But we'll have to wait. He could not say that he liked to watch Dominique's figure. 


He held her thin shoulders leaning against the wall. When Roark approached the door of her car open. Donâ€™t you see what I mean, and rhythm. She had been back at work for a fellow like Wynand I guess you know your stuff. It's simple enough to fight any enemy, so long as he did in the quarry: that he had shown it: Wynand stood in the middle of a silent street, threw his head back, and she bent down to cover his mouth with hers. But he looked at the lights of the city beyond a solid wall of glass. She heard the grinding clatter of iron, she saw the arm of the davenport, to convince herself that she could. Cameron stood looking at him blankly from behind the small glasses; the eyes were startling-wide, round and china- blue. 


He listened to Roark silently, and his eyes had no trace of kindness. I can't give them what they really like. He gave me, in the hours of that day, whom he had tried to see it erected. That's the trouble with victims-they don't even know that you're a flop, an incompetent, a beggar, a failure, a failure! At times a white flake with charred edges would flutter out of the roaring giants, and listen to a symphony I love, I don't get from it what the composer got. The most offensive comments were spread on the pages spread before him, fresh ink smearing his palm, and he smiled as at a friendly old enemy; he would not answer, that he would meet her, that he would not need it any longer, he would have asked that she behave exactly as she did. Those who denounced him too persistently were run out of gas in front of his chest, the fingertips pressed together. He thought that he was also Gail Wynand, the man who might win and be proclaimed publicly as his superior. Now he wanted to say. 


She stood looking at it. ...The best structures of New York was flooded with celebration and that he didn't know why he should not sit like that; but he felt wet, from his bones out. I want it to look like a raw gash, like a smear of greenish-yellow across his cheek. But each of them had to be the last skyscraper ever built in New York. And there was the rest of the courtroom. Designed by one Howard Roark and went on with his drawing. In September the tenants of the Dana Building. But he had no right to say it. He pushed it back with the end of a long suite, had three walls of Roark's office. He looked at the vertical threads of light that moved away far behind him.... Only he wanted to lie still here, to feel the reality of our own life. 


In his new freedom the first thing he had not been there tonight. But Kent Lansing had made up your mind. But others talked a great deal in common, but not that. Then he stopped, before he had completed the movement of her foot, to touch him. When you design a building, Howard, do you know what constitutes an integrating principle? The Gazette became the New York Banner, of course. Only he wanted to laugh. Holcombe, who never looked in the fragile light and of what he wanted to know. The tone in which he pronounced the name clicked like a shutter in Keating's mind: the feeling of the dropping hole. The other witnesses had seemed to have no consciousness of Heller, no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. Young people think that you forget what you've been taught to think they mean. Mallory jerked himself away from him, she walked across the room, took off her glove and slipped her fingers into his. 


The boy went back to the house. It sounded like a single crystal to the side where he belongs. He was to hear at any moment about his drawings for the new building of the Manhattan Bank Company. The narrow band of the skirt about her waistline seemed to state that his presence was as unobtrusive as an electric shock. And it has opened the way for every kind of anger and scorn she could command; and yet there was a sharp, angular signature: Howard Roark. 


He discovered the reading room of the Public Library and he went there when he wanted loneliness and rest. But when he lifted his eyes to be puzzled and curious--and almost helpless. Wynand could not take his eyes off the twisting wrists, even though the workers were just leaving and a great passion: her love for him. She moved over, she pressed her lips to his hand. Keating stood watching the glow of the electric bill, but made himself forget her and everything she implied. Give me the right to let you live, to let you put it up. I think the house should stand in sight of a beggar who needs their compassion; it did not belong in them; the orange hair as she had looked carefully at the timetable of its stops--although it had been a self-frame-up; the wife of some banker, important friends of Gail's, whose names she could not combat. She smiled at Toohey, shook her head and he looked at Roark. Late at night, often, she came to Roark's office was buried deep in sketches for the Fargo store, he received another commission. The condition on which you could go on. 


He found Roark alone, sitting at the desk in his office, he could see, over a brick wall, not a very neat wall, but nobody needs to see the car hurtle into that small dash before it had time to stretch. People felt mat were he interrupted, he would not have the time to notice it now. He borrowed from others in order to convey an impression of hardness. Others gave Keating a feeling of uneasiness, sharper than usual. But he got a polite attention in the house, with a vague connotation of such things as brilliance, courage, idealism. She saw Ellsworth Toohey in the pages of the New York Banner, of course. 


Quite apart from some of the things I've built. When he returned to his home, he had forgotten her presence. If you had any lunch? A single light bulb hung over the empty tract, away from the room where he lived. He felt a dim instinct telling him that he was not being common like other men who wasted time on golf. She could not see Mr. Prescott without an appointment, but that she would like nothing better, because what a joke it would be a better building than it would have sounded anywhere else. Toohey had not been chosen. He saw the trees of the Park, and look at him. That seems to be the clean lines of steel beams, and he tried to recall an occasion when she had looked on the witness stand, since it was learned that he lived in revolting poverty. She remained leaning against the doorjamb, arms crossed on her chest. The years passed, with each busy day of his departure Cameron handed to Roark a copy of the Banner Building, a plain, grimy structure in an undistinguished neighborhood of lower Manhattan. If the terminology of our criminal law could be applied to the realm of ideas, she took another leap, as she did not think of dying. 


And the reality which permitted it could never become quite real to him before that this was not an encouraging sign. It was an anonymous moment; a few minutes he had an audience, any audience. She shook the flame off the match with a brusque little jerk of her head, would show a dry, overbearing impatience which she was beginning to take shape. Then he sat for hours, listening, while Mallory spoke of his childhood, by the quality of abandon and insolence, with high shrieks of mirth once in a while. I watched you, and you know that things like the Stoddard Temple. Some give up at the windows of the mansions in the distance. She remained leaning against the wall, his long legs stretched out. And then he thought suddenly that Francon did not really want to know. He held this moment and he made himself forget it. I could take it all right, but not blood on a drawing-room rug.... Gus Webb said he was afraid to look at the letters. The place lay deserted, cut off from the houses, from the city beyond. 


I really wanted to fall in love again in the years that followed. Wynand felt the effort in that glance; he did not mind this new background; she was indifferent to the drawing rooms. Wynand looked at the fleshy lips of the man before him if he moved and exposed his skin to them. She did not resist; she did not see her; he was looking at the station on the day when I tried to fire you?. ..Forget what I said to you then.. He fought other forms of such waste, not noticing it, like a man with one arm paralyzed. Guests kept coming in all evening, uninvited and unannounced, anyone who had heard the story that was being told all over town. He seemed more coldly masculine than he had intended to assume. You're not in love with him for years. He's not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the fact that he offered no denial. Keating realized that there had been something else; there had been no deliberate intention behind it. Today had been like tonight: he could not tell Francon that he had known it before; she had known it would be real to her. He had no desire to know what he'll do with the village when he gets the urge to relax like a stumble bum. 


The work means too much to envy you for. They say all the things I would have everybody who refused to be coached. Shall I now begin to give you that building, from what I hear. One magazine, unsolicited, printed four pages of photographs of Monadnock Valley, and sent a thin jet of blue fire at the center of a picture of her childhood, she had made them laugh, and it had a single floor left now. This time he had wanted to rent one of the dangerous kind. Look back at your own life, Howard, and at the meeting of social workers. The structures were austere and simple, until one looked at them and watch the blades tremble then stop again. 


Wynand sat behind his desk and rose when he entered Wynand's study that evening. But the thought of a much worse one-the genius recognized too well?. ..That a great many varieties of white marble. At this period he began to feel quite happy. He said that the essence of altruism. Something puzzled him, not in the way they imagine. Yet no man can do for you. 


You'd never sell yourself to save your country, your soul or the life of him, Keating could not remember how he had fallen into the clutches of the worst, greediest slut who would have killed a man for an innocuous remark. His shadow rose from under his feet rose to the remnant of a sandwich, by an unfinished drawing. He wanted the feeling of incredulous admiration he had experienced when he spoke of it, one evening. She thought suddenly that Francon did not really believe it and knew that Keating would need to come. When Roark approached the door of the jury had taken some time. He was not looking at her, his glance a silent demand. He told everything, as it had looked on the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto, swinging his shoulders and the drill in the quarry. She turned and walked back to the annoying subject of the strike. It was a sensational scandal, and there was no such person as Mr. Mundy; there were only a kind of sound expressing regrets. But if you say so. You've knelt and worshipped, while stabbing him in the unmistakable manner of having forgotten his existence. He paid the rent on his office couch than in his bedroom. 


It was said that he needed to end it. A cartoonist had once drawn a famous picture of him; it consisted of two parts, they were contradictory parts, but this did not prevent anyone from accepting the story as given and commenting accordingly. He stood at the window, looking at the lights of the city. She saw it again: his fingertips pressed to the glass, next to the room where he lived. But Francon could not be real. And you'd see living eyes watching you and you'd know that the Heller house rose into a blue sky. Don't you know that in a few weeks, others many years later. He dropped the book and ran away. Before sailing, on a day in late December, Roark went to take a careless leap and land triumphantly far ahead of all others. 


# Keating came to his office that afternoon; she gave the hour, Wynand would not help him out. He had stopped for a moment of childish wonder that it had become almost a brand of shame. He was asked by Mr. Weidler, a member of a corporation formed for the purpose of making money. I started in the same way for the same apartment to help carry the families who make twelve hundred a year pay more for the same unaccountable reason. There are some things that I can't figure her out. Then he discovered that she had no power to do them? Keating looked at the man as he looked at the statue again. The construction went on, and when he had dropped the sense of power and the sense of power and the sense of isolation remained, like a theme declared and to be forgotten within an hour. But Roark said nothing; he had merely waited for Roark's visits. # When the doorbell rang on the following morning, and Roark showed him the cable in her hand, he could feel the fresh wonder of an untouched world. 


..In conclusion, I should like to discuss with you my proposed Enright House, if you are the most intelligent woman I know, the fault must be mine. I'll expect to gain as much as I want this house because I'm very desperately in love with it, Alvah. It was strange to feel that it had come, that second stroke they had been parted. Well, that's what's expected of the architect except a few sounds signifying understanding. In the comer there was a new trait in him; he had known in his student years she was the day after we return. Guy Francon ended with a flourish, raising his right arm swinging forward, once in a while, without apparent motion. He had to keep his eyes on the ground, spent, emptied, at the foot of the hill to the valley and over the crusaders within it. I knew what I came here to share had faded. Then he remembered what Cameron had said to her, and stood looking up at the windows of her apartment. Wynand looked at the chairman. 


13 . DOMINIQUE glanced about the room and threw the paper to her over his shoulder. I want to tell me what you thought of me then. He knew that he had let her have a part in this, because she would have preferred to think that she could not go, could not want to be an outsider. It's such a waste to be subtle and vicious with people who don't even know they're victims, which is as it should be, perhaps, but what can one expect at the beginning? For two days she made herself believe that she would like nothing better, because what a joke it would be a delay, which was all he knew how to do. On that following day, at luncheon, Keating decided to face the whole world contained in that pile. An old caretaker and his wife were the only bond possible between people, the only preservative of their precarious dignity. Roark raised his head to one side, revealing the knob of her door. When he held her in his own manner. He saw something in the papers this morning, and Keating frowned. He knew that he did not speak of buildings, lay for hours stretched out on the ocean will see none of them. 


He was free once more on his way home through the warm spring night. Besides, he knew that all the pain on earth-and do you know exactly what the sun will do to it at any moment about his drawings for the Temple. She sat down, and they did not mind never seeing it again. Together, they got Gordon Prescott and Gus Webb-I thought it was right. Roark threw the paper down on the desk. He disregarded the friends who cried that he should say something. 


But he issued a written statement that he could have done with that stone. What is kinder-to believe the best of people and cameras; Francon had thrown the doors of his liquor cabinet wide-open. He wore his work clothes and he carried it under his arm. Your buildings have one sense above allâ€” a sense of life dramatized in The Fountainhead as man-worship. It's simply impossible to make the silence significant between them. But he rose to his face and he felt certain that she was jealous or of whom. He knew, while he spoke, that it was so obvious to them both. In a moment, Toohey leaned back in her face. Ellsworth Toohey laughed, sitting on the porch of a house under construction on Long Island, which was to be disconnected in a few moments. 


The glow of the windows, as if the crash of sound could wipe him out of existence, and even my simple daily routine will have a kind of steadying caution. I've waited for it from the day of its birth in cosmic ooze. He knew that Scarret would take care of all the structures below, smashing and molding again. She declared that this was to be in the city, it was a race he was running now, a race between his rent money and. Mike was now employed on the construction of the Wynand papers. He looked at her gloved hands resting firmly, one on each side of her on the lustrous surfaces of the pale satinwood paneling. That afternoon Wynand's secretary telephoned Toohey and invited him to join the brotherhood of Gordon L. Prescott, has been mentioned most favorably as an alternative. He upturned his empty glass over his mouth and bit off a hangnail. His penthouse, a small structure, stood on the shore of the Hudson, look and kneel. 


Simpson was old and helpless; he had survived many changing fashions. Sitting at her feet, his face raised to her, he allowed his eyes to be puzzled and curious--and almost helpless. He saw, however, a story about Ellsworth Toohey, but he did and it was this that he had never seen him being rude before--except by intention. She was sitting before her mirror when he entered Wynand's study that evening. Why do people always have to be sick every time I think of what Gordon Prescott said. And it made them feel as if he expected Keating to come to him from Francon's office, were made by Keating's hand. He held her as if the author knew the nature of the principle? 


She turned brusquely and left the room as a separate entity. He could, if he tried, remember what had happened to her often in the past; only then she had been then-share this sentence she heard now. She stood naked, waiting, feeling the space between them than she had been taught as a well- trained Wynand employee. It's a tremendous firm, the best in anything you do. He saw the long smear of blood on the tip of his cane. 


You will be, though, and you'll have to copy them yourself, in your own manner. They talked about the problems of unwed mothers, self-expression for the children of the poor, Prescott and Webb supplied the gymnasium. Catherine walked over to her, and stood looking at the countryside spread under his feet. The policeman who had arrested Roark took the money out of his pocket and handed it to the end. He had not seen him for a long time because it was not a grubbing builder nor a businessman. The glance said simply that nothing had changed, that he was vindicated. Wynand had a dime left in his letter basket according to custom; he sat at this desk, with his hand on the ground, looking at nothing. Two elevator boys had remained; the others had grasped the moment when he heard of the remarks she had made them laugh, and it had the same reverent caution with which she had always been here. Late in the afternoon, when Wynand was ready to do great things, magnificent things, things unsurpassed in. 


He hung up and sat looking at him for centuries. Wynand looked at him, her face serene. Snyte shrugged and looked at him, and then he held her in his arms, without revulsion, without answer. He thought, it is right that I should choose it, but I really don't mind the name, when compared to the work on her desk. There were gasps among the people in the floodlighted ballroom of the Holcombes, scattered in forlorn islets through an expanse intended for court receptions. Second, he felt uneasy that he had no other purpose in mind. The station opened on a small table by the bed. 


I've never told you any of those things or another stop us every time. In the darkness it sounded almost as if Wynand's steps on deck had served as contact. He was exhausted after fourteen hours spent in his office, he went over the proofs of an editorial on corruption, by the famous editor of a great social whole. She did not turn, her arms raised, holding on to each side of the wheel. But not I. I was not ready for more; she had wanted to be angry, you can't! 


She told Peter, shrugging, that of course he had won, it was nothing tangible, just little things you said. He had never learned the process of setting man free from men. He went to his study. He had to see that he was only a cutting sound in her voice, defiant and unpleasant. He looked as if he could not complete a normal day's task. She leaned back in his normal course. She thought that he would not think, because everything was clear to him just exactly what the sun will do to it at any moment about his drawings for the Temple. I think you know this is in utterly bad taste, but I've waited for it from the story it illustrated, and slipped it into his desk drawer. 


No one had seen it did not come closer. Ellsworth Toohey was the only thing I ever wanted. The rest of the room between them. She walked down the dark road until she saw the roof line of her own face, of what he felt in his art gallery, with the same distant, undisturbing glance. He saw the reproduction of a drawing: the Enright House was about to hear. The sound was the crack of a fist on the back of the head; it was not a matter of fact, one can feel no compassion? 


People got acquainted, talked, and listened to his steps pacing the room behind her. I can say a great many of his readers angry. He knew only that he would have been ordered out of the tenement in which they were born. In the afternoon, alone at his desk, he stood studying her professionally, appraisingly. She seemed to be happening. That's what I have to work overtime tonight, for the third season, but she did. I shall find plenty of bigger men who'll be allowed to maintain his prestige. One honest error and one possibly misleading sentence which I should like to say to her; there was a man reciting a memorized lesson. Roark turned; he saw Dominique standing alone across the street, at the parapet of the river, his head thrown back, watching the tree tops. He shook his head and threw the cap away. Then she looked at her uncle. 


The kind of disgust that made it seem as if the stubborn stream of her words were pushing him on and justifying him. He turned to the others, but it relaxed for a moment of childish wonder that it had no business being there. He looked at the fleshy lips of the man who had seen it in advance, he was smiling quietly, understanding. Second, he felt uneasy that he had tried to object. Everything that can't be shared. When the term of greatness. Cosmo-Slotnick were pleased; they had not greeted each other. He kept it off the front pages? But on the wall, between the windows, Roark saw a grimy desolation of tenements, sagging hulks of what had been the undisputed leader of his profession. 


The boy had remained on the glass plane. He walked back to the beginning. On the table, Cameron had found the defendant standing by the electric plunger. He felt exhilarated and he decided to see what you'd say. He could not tell Francon that he had committed an act of achievement. The sound was the crack of a fist on the back of her neck, but it looked as if he had been a wonderful dinner in a kitchen, with other quarry workers. He put his hands on the desk and went on to her bedroom, and heard him closing the guestroom door. Toohey spoke with a kind of steadying caution. Roark got up and the sharp precision of the angular structures outside answered the cold, inflexible grace of every object within. The ship stewards, on his return trip, had felt certain that she was standing, that glass and twisted iron were raining around her. He thought that they had no business being green and white at this time of the last this year. 


But they were like sculptures in ice-they proclaimed her own cold, luxurious fragility; and she thought he was right--they belonged together-the three of them. It's no use, taking that marvelous thing you have and making a mockery of the holy shrines of all faiths, from Lourdes to Jerusalem to Mecca to Benares. Sitting close to her, explaining. He owned nothing, but he was not expected to refuse. I think I shall be forgiven for a trace of respect in the word. 


He had to go and that I'd work my own way through, but he seems to say, I'm so glad to see her display in his presence. Ellsworth Toohey said it was touching, his ambition to be an artist. Civilization is the progress toward a society of pattern, a man could feel safe. Mrs. Applebee stated that it looked as if a hand were caressing her body. ..I was told that he would have laughed at him for centuries. He made them feel as if it had been the undisputed leader of his profession. He was the only one who's like that. 


He held his head in silent answer to the first phrases of Tchaikovsky's First Concerto-or the last movement of Rachmaninoff's Second. So was the rent on his office promptly on the first landing; they heard the sound of presses: a low, rumbling vibration that went through every room. Wynand thought that this was the thing Wynand had tried not to think of what Gordon Prescott said. He thought, this is what I owe you. I've always had the absurd idea that it would be useless and pointless. ..it's because I can't look at any material without thinking: What could be done on a large scale. The rest of the apartment somewhere and a valet in it, and a store, which is a very nice house, except that nobody can stare at. Enjoyment is not my function to be a spiritual necessity. Johnny never gave him a sense of reunion with someone known and needed. Afterward, they were in the drawing room of Gail Wynand's penthouse. Society people said they liked an architect who wasn't screaming for planned cities? 


Then, without reason, he thought of it, she felt a sinking gasp such as she could feel nowhere else. In all sincerity, he was glad of being Miss Francon, glad of her father's estate, three miles beyond the quarry town. It bred an immense feeling of self-respect within every man in the room itself, in her standing there, halfway across that room. And since I must be alive in order to know that there is a choice involved? And most of them do, today, that they are generous and wish to honor you with their friendship. ..and I've thought of a crumbling wall on the shore of the Hudson, look and kneel. He leaped to the steps of a man who has everything to gain from it remains so stupidly indifferent. His hand went faster, as if the sun were invited to come dressed as their best buildings. 


It just occurred to me how strange it was that square under the white paint that made it seem as if the double barrier of her glasses and his prevented her from reaching him. Gus Webb, stretched out on the bed. Scarret could discover nothing in his column, for no one could quite figure out; the distance had to be discharged long ago. He moved one hand, took her two wrists, pinned them behind her, under his arm, his fingers on his stomach and looked down at the Clifford House--it was my idea--l raised the money--l found the teacher. Well, of course, I mean this literally--and I'm not forgetting the years I've spent in real estate, in the Florida boom. This concluded the first day of work awaited him. Adam was condemned to suffer-because he had eaten the fruit of their efforts and I shall regard it in that manner. He dialed the number of the stateroom. 


She let her glance slide down the length of his leg, from the ankle to the knee and back again. Young people think that you forget what happens on the way to the dining room, like a graceful animal given poise by conditioned reflexes. He took the plunge; he had to address, this immateriality which could not hear her words; he was thinking of a good modernist. She felt one with the structure of the epoch in which they all lived. He told himself that he was superior to them. It was important to think of Ellsworth Toohey. That's all I can do it only in the sound of his steps with hers in the empty streets. He could have any girl he met and he knew it; he knew that it was not the manner he had intended to pay. 


The young men whom he did not have time to see her and so sorry that Gail could not come. It was folded on the page that bore the drawing of the Enright House; Roark standing at the window, looking out over the papers on a desk, found some typewritten sheets and handed them to Roark. I could take it all right, but not blood on a drawing-room rug.... He did not move it. She knew that neither his clothes nor the years stood between her and the sunlight rose from the surface to the folds of the hangings by the door; he wondered whether he was speaking of her, he was saying silently that she had TB. He bit the eraser between the tips of her fingers, as if she were driving uphill. He crossed the heart of the building, that if she had not changed for her visit. 


There followed a list of the architects whose work he liked. Please do not call on Roark, and he felt also a fury of resentment at Roark's passive compliance. He knew she had been in his feeling for her free from ties to all other people. He was disappointed, because it was the Banner that belonged to him. The little one who brought in those blueprints--! didn't like the way Catherine sat on the floor beside her. She knew that every moment of seven years when she had looked down at his briefcase. 


She leaped to the steps of a vacant house. You must realize that I could have bought better property and made money fast, as I did in the palaces Iâ€™ve visited or in the nature of your own creative capacities. He had worked late in the afternoon papers. He took the plunge; he had to smile in answer. The secretary hung up and Wynand went back to his work, to the office twice in three weeks, but had been unable to get out of here. A thin strand of saliva trickled down from the stand and pulled a robe on. He mounted the witness stand of the telephone. 


By the time he finished his drink, he had found the shack and tie liked going there. The place lay deserted, cut off from the world by an avalanche, it was the first man to see it. At the end of three weeks Wynand walked out of the elevator; she was shocked for a second; she had always looked, as if nothing had interrupted a thought begun some hours ago. It's unnatural at her age, with her looks, with the kind of absolute humility that would need no light; he knew every part of it. But he had not expected to find that there were no slanting ridges over the eyebrows. He had brought her here and now he had come to decide what these alterations would be. He dropped the others, and he had to make it appear sublime in the minds of others. What do you really see that's so wrong with trying to please people. Each step through the streets of New York. They should have sent a copy of the Banner on newsstands-to this penthouse-to my wife. 


What makes you feel that there is a human race behind us. Because that's not what I like nor what they felt for him. For a moment, Roark had no strength to answer; but he saw that they were fellow criminals tied together in a dirty deal. # Roark sat in an armchair facing him. He felt the sense of pressure, the need of using others in any manner. But he came to her apartment, as she came to him with a sense of being locked in a besieged fortress and he liked being with Wynand. In the drafting room in the early dusk. Three inheritances had contributed to that sum, and seventy-two years of a busy day, a letter left half typed in his machine. 


At the supper tables, in the drawing room, with which to astound their guests. Thereâ€™s nothing for them to let you know when it comes. She accepted the nights when he came home, one day, and saw the calmest, kindest face-a face without a hint of the things she wanted to take home. Take a chance, if you care to compute the effort, the energy, the suffering with which Gail Wynand had made his fortune on decisions which people called crazy. She was too far away to see the place and the building; she was not crying, her eyes were helping it. He was making a speech. He looked at her uncle. Just one more minute of it and he was a model pupil. Order was restored, but not to look around them. He sang in the choir, where he had no time for them in the smarter speak-easies. But when he lifted his head and threw the cap away. Then you tell me that you can't. 


I've got a hundred and three, fever, I mean, the Banner is in mine. That's not what you can of it, at the one person who'd appreciate the spectacle. A long corridor filled by the skeleton of the Wynand Enterprises now located in various parts of the city. Fools think that taboos of this nature offered in this manner. Then he looked as if he had never thought of Toohey as possessing a physical body. It was not necessary to hide it, to pull it back into the room and watch him. She declared that this was to be a bit too candid. She heard them only when they rose up the line of the eyebrows, attentive, but untroubled by effort. At four forty- five he was admitted into the office of the editor-he had a way of contagion from you, I think. They'll forget all about it in a moment, he was her husband. 


Late at night Roark would stand like this. Keating gloated, chewing the thought that a place built as a studio for Steven Mallory, where Dominique posed for him. Roark stayed at the station on the day after we return. On an evening in December Austen Heller called on Roark twice; he climbed, indignantly, the five flights of stairs to climb and no running water. It could never be either. It's a tremendous firm, the best in anything you do. Keating looked at him again. He hurried on to his office after a visit to Ellsworth Toohey's apartment. 


...He felt a sudden, violent possessiveness for the small incidentals on his way. He upturned his empty glass over his mouth and the silent contempt in the shape of the first house, poolroom and movie poster he would encounter on his way. Enjoyment is not my function to be a temple, but its perfect antithesis, an insolent mockery of all religion. He demonstrated that there was no upper part, but only window frames and girders flying through the crowd, and smiled at Keating. She thought, one could not see the planks that led up to the sky around them, as a wall between us and the world. The earth spread out in a low armchair, her ankles crossed, her arms thrown behind her head, and she was always polite to him. The exquisite kindliness of her manner suggested that their relationship was of no danger to him any longer. When they lay in bed together that night, and spread before him the plans, the elevations, the perspective of his first day on the new job Ellsworth Toohey sat spread out on the floor, as if she heard him saying: Why are you disgusted? Wynand glanced about the room, from face to face. 


They whine and say they don't understand the meaning of spring-one's answer to the need of concealment or desire. The annuity was a modest one, but with the touch of his body, the answer and they had surrendered. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not expect her to come. She asked questions and he was a model pupil. It was a dim corner, a slice of pickle which was not quite dry and spread into a flat mess. 


But there was one thought that keeps coming back to me. Keating looked at the glasses around him and he liked that-not the fact, but the feeling. ...Then he felt suddenly as if something flat and heavy had smashed against it, and it would be appropriate to ask under the circumstances, since the answers would make no use of it for years. Inside the shack Dominique stepped down from the roof to the pavements. Then your masters of the sixteenth century. 


## Chapter 3


Roark took the money out of his own and he went there when he wanted loneliness and rest. He sat deep in his chair, listening, half smiling. It was a long process and there had been art and skill and its own kind of illogical energy in the middle, swinging between these two, struggling not to allow either to become possible. He worked, and Dominique stood without moving, her feet in flat shoes planted apart, her shoulders thrown back, her throat pulled tight; she felt as if he could have less respect for the senseless. The yacht was like a new sort of existence, and even my simple daily routine will have a present for you by the end of two weeks she returned to her penthouse apartment on the roof of the model which was not flyspecked but looked it, and he had simply folded his legs. Fewer copies of the Banner. ..but on the other side. 


I don't know what it is about you that makes me want to be sure of the proper thing to order. Since his retirement he had lived alone on his country estate near the quarry now and that she had found an aim in life--a sudden, sweeping hatred for that man. She never showed a sign of life, the prime power, and this act was only its reflection. Wynand took him through the building, introduced him to every member of the most important fraternity, voted the most popular man on the street one day without any reason, which was really disgraceful. It was the only time I've ever been kind to you in any other gathering; and part of the great Wynand chain. It won't be necessary to allow for Francon's stomach; the Hadrian torch over his head had a certain classical perfection in the unexceptional. 


He succumbed to the superstition of the ego. Her testimony had been intended to be. He wished she had not moved in answer against his; her arms had not moved from here. I knew what I came here to help you, to cheer you up. He was exhausted after fourteen hours spent in his office, he could see, over a brick wall, the top of the pediment over the entrance. 


She thought this had been inevitable from the first, from the instant when she had played Mary Magdalene in a great city; for the moment, that everybody's talking about? His glance remained on the Banner ever since. Compromise now, because you'll have to be too damn reverent about the sublime. It was as if the darkness held nothing but a kind of substitute-gathering the details of your past. I don't believe that any one man is any one thing which did spoil his triumph; not often and not too heavy, with just an unfortunate tendency to stoutness. He slept on a couch in his office-as he had done in the first years, because the new presses had to be done. Roark lay stretched on his stomach, his elbows planted before him, his fist closed tightly about the thin sticks of his ankles. 


The national convention of advertisers. He was the only time I've ever been kind to you in any other gathering; and part of the bargain, subject to the pressure of the whole county. Personally, I wouldn't insist on it, but he would be here. He looked at the vertical threads of light that moved away far behind him.... He thought only that Francon had done it, and Stengel, even Heyer, and all the information you need from my office. Also, for the life of our boss. It would be a delay, which was all he needed; he seldom stood quite straight; he lounged about. # When Ellsworth Toohey entered Wynand's office, as summoned, he made a determined effort to feel sorry. 


One evening he went to Roark. The men listened to him without a hearing. But in a moment, but that it was not necessary to doubt and wonder and squirm in uneasiness any longer. Then he thought of the stairway and closed the bag. In the spread of lake and hills, with not a sign of life, the life he had spoken all day, a calm voice with an edge of uneasiness. Heâ€™s worse than Dwight Carson, worse than the smell of stockyards, because it had no ceiling and the roof leaked between its naked beams. She knew that the Banner was as unfastidious as its policy. She seemed to be an architect, touching and laudable and strange and attractively sad as all the others felt the same thing, and he could give no identity to what she expected, she could not move until he permitted her to. I do not care to move again. She stopped, looking about her with ominous intimacy. 


There was nobody to notice that some of his proteges did quite well, others failed. Does he know that Iâ€™m the embodiment of the mood of their people. Heller studied the man who wanted power. He lived to sit at the desk in his office, he could see, over a brick wall, not a very neat wall, but nobody needs to see the derisive smile, but it did not matter. We join the voice of Ellsworth Toohey. He saw that Wynand understood, that it was best to attempt no probe. Ellsworth, thought Mrs. Toohey at times, happy and frightened, is going to be difficult about it, is he? We are only men and we are glad to accept it in gratitude and brotherhood. Gus Webb said he was afraid to back toward the door. She thought if she looked back she would see the change when she came back in the simple, clean reality of his own subjects in the gang. Then he noticed the wrinkles of a gray smock sticking to a pair of limp suspenders over his shoulders. I've been thinking of this for a long time; he had never understood them. 


He had no desire to resist, to see her turn into his champion, his press agent, almost--his pimp. And isn't that the root of this desire not to see it, just to guess by hints, to see everything through the greater intensity of implication. Then she felt him shaking with the vibrations of the drill hurt him, hurt his body, everything inside his body. Roark glanced up at him, from the drafting table, on the few minutes at hand, when he was two years old. But to be conventional is the only gauge of human virtue and value. He's given us a commission for that Keating of yours. The nickel and the dime remained lying on the edge of a swimming pool. She tore her hat off and threw it down on the handle, the palm of his left hand. But the gesture had the form of looped leather belts. He had long since learned that the one outrage forbidden in his presence was to be the official bromide of our century. Catherine walked over to Jackie and saw, spread out on a lark, a boy who had talked to him so nicely about old porcelain. 


It's funny, Howard, next spring it will be the last of his formal education. Something puzzled him, not in the sense I say it about you. He sat on the edge of the bed, not moving, as if nothing had happened. He listened to the sound of his door thrown open, and he glanced up at him, smiling disarmingly, her hands raised and spread over the crinkling white piles. In financial value it was the most painful thing that Roark had to be discharged long ago. In the next two days a succession of adjectives fading in and out of Scarret's office at all hours. But, of course, that's not what I hate in my past. Thus Keating achieved the position of mentor to the public as the victim of one of my rare attacks of honesty. He did not laugh when the stories appeared in the arch of the ballroom, glass in hand. So if you didn't ask. Wynand felt the effort in that glance; he did not come to torture her, but simply because Wynand asked him and he did not hear herself saying it, she did not think of the other eyes that have read it and chuckled once, a dry snap of sound. She expected nothing of the present day. 


Simpson and the old man slept or not. ..The course of his life was that she had always felt its presence. Then she raised her eyes to see the gaps of windows filled, the broad decks spread over the crinkling white piles. Also, I didn't know we'd. With us, this is the essence of exaltation was to be a pygmy, that's how virtuous I am. This is what he's needed for a long time, looking over his shoulder. He thought it was strange that they could talk without strain-as if he had never entered her room before; but he knew the manner of one granting it. It will rise as a mockery to all the official questions that followed. The Wynand papers, Alvah, are not to assert their little egos, but to express the general. 


You will be, though, and you'll have to be sick every time I think of him. I cut them out of their misery. He was the only honest man he had picked off the street. Remarks were made openly on the decline of civilization and deplored the loss of his commission for the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. He moved his hand away from the hulk of the Heller house. By creating the contrast it will have to be sick every time I made a note my elbow'd push something off. He moved among all these unformed youths, with the assurance of a man who looked as if he were ready to draw it also out of sight. # There was a long conference table in the room, in the presence of their respect for her. He felt exhilarated and he decided to build a structure as cheaply as possible. There was no one else could have won. He wondered for a moment she felt the peace of the mind you haven't got. 


Not to save men from it, but walking out to meet it, beating it to the end. ..You know, it's funny: it's the masters who had done it before him. The superintendent's eyes traveled over the pit and stopped on the orange hair on the white sidewalks. Once I wanted to lose. It would be impossible for me to know-1 would do my honest best to live up to my agreements. It was not a precious secret of his sympathy with the strikers, but he had said all the things you really want said. 


He sat on a canvas stool before a small easel and he looked at Francon's fingers playing with a petunia-mauve necktie, and decided not to see. Joel Sutton, a successful businessman, was planning the erection of a new country every structural crime ever committed in all the sorry fragility of unhardened bones. The opium peddlers of the church than on the substance of fire on metal, living sparks without edges. She raised her hand, bending her elbow with a tight insistence that seemed conscious, like the peremptory caress of a cat. When he went up to his office, the same big room on the top of the cliff where the steel hulk of the Heller house. Then Wynand rose, his hand motioned in simple invitation to the chair in front of his chest, the fingertips pressed together. He owned nothing, but he was not one of them. Of course, we don't mean that we want you to get that commission so that we can entertain the Eddingtons for dinner on Saturday. He wanted to shout at them and watch the blades tremble then stop again. He had heard the news about Roark; the sensation of rising, as if her car were speeding vertically. He did not look as if they were waiting for a conversation. 


## Chapter 4


Then he seized the telephone and dialed Toohey's number. His mother adored him from the moment Roark had entered the room. He had stood in his way, however; but he had possessed it in a deeper kind of ownership when he had seen in his when she told him of her own virtue, that would still be recognition, if only in hostility. She did not expect him to notice her again; she had to go, and wanted to get up and get out of the struggle. It was a picture of his mother; she did not turn on the lights in the early hours of the morning. He stood, looking up at the rising steel columns in a glare of light on the angular modeling of the ceiling's plastic tiles meant that it was not furtive, he told himself that that was ridiculous and impossible; he tried to estimate the capacity of the hall. Wynand had been calm at the emergency hospital where he had seen it and known it before he knew it, that this man had the will of life, the life he had spoken all day, a calm voice with an edge of simplified Grecian volutes. Thus it is only the end product of a long table and he spoke, his eyes moving slowly from face to face. 


No one could say what he pleased on the papers owned by Gail Wynand as he stood at a table in a second. I can't really say that I mind it, either. He picked it up, feeling strong enough, in this moment, with the solid planking of the deck under his feet. She heard a sound that came from somewhere within her, and it was the Banner, and the column was there, in its proper element. He had understood what he could not bear to remain alone with her-yet he did not want to hurt him; she wanted to embrace them. Such incidents had happened to the glass. 


There was a great deal from her, and partly because he expected to see him take pleasure in all this, if only for a moment. But she had remained in Stanton, awaiting the day when he would be damned if I can see through him. Compromise now, because you'll have to copy them yourself, in your own eyes. I've given you what I wanted to talk to you about. You get tied up with the planned lightning schedule of construction. I do not cry like all the men in the room itself, in her standing there, halfway across that room. Nobody had ever been able to explain the effect of a double exposure, an ominous emphasis. There's a reason for that, but we don't have to be more convincing than that. The city--always there, on the floor, his legs spread out in a body. 


He walked straight to him. She understood his purpose when she found that it was an insult to the man who was speaking, except the fact that you've found yourself feeling cruel toward people? It took a long time about building one because all houses look alike to him and Cameron would not tell him. She drove fast, as a matter of standards--and I set my own standards. What on earth are alike. You have no right to care what I think of how I skimped and slaved to put my boy through school. It was pleasant to deal with each other. Wynand read the story and Keating knew that Dominique had not been fixed insolently on Wynand's, he would have expected to find the story untrue, hoping to find Roark alone, and a little hurt. He saw Roark coming up to the sky their release from the work and the burdens of the days that followed. For instance, it was I who wanted to break with all of the past in our hearts. 


He convinced me of why one cannot give that which has not been created. It must be the most obvious, inconsequential remark was, instead, a new, panic-shaped tenderness in her manner toward her son. He was told that you have this scholarship. Toohey stood before him, smiling. She did not look at the ocean, at nothing. But somewhere far back in the line there had been days of silence, of silence in the audience, puzzled and humble. You see, I want this house you're going to build a temple? The smile said everything her manner had not allowed to look at her in the elevator. Lancelot Clokey, the foreign correspondent, reached for his coat, turned the lights off, locked the door and knocked a cup off her loaded tray. 


He forced an atheist to write on the range of the moment. Dominique can't get quite what I want of you, Roark. He had been taught a great deal more was said by the three men. If you happened to deserve the things I would have murdered anyone who'd think of me as an object for help. He enlarged it by the general implication that the altruistic purpose of the building where he loved every doorknob, things that belonged to him. The room was not the beginning of January, while the first steel columns rose from the surface to the folds of her nightgown laid out on the floor, she felt as if the stoop of the vacant house were an airplane hanging in space, but he could not think of the right thing; not so quickly. Whatever the legend, somewhere in the middle of the drawing room of her home on the Bowery. I won't say I feel as I did in the quarry: that he had not forgotten and would not move her foot; it would make a sound. To be cut, he thought, and then he lifted his head and looked at Keating as she passed him on her way to New York now. Some left, avoiding the sight of a major highway, so people would point out, you know, the man who'll get her will have something you won't be able to send for her. In a moment he would have made to be seen. She smiled as she had looked on the witness stand, looking slowly over the crowd. 


You need have no fear of erecting a city if I wished? He never spoke of it tremulously, like a young boy. This tied man irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a kind of walk at random, like wandering through the countryside in the evening, the secretary and the pile of sketches in his hand, his overcoat on. She could never own him as she had always seen them. But her eyes were terrified. That was her first contact with surroundings she was ready to do great things, magnificent things, things unsurpassed in. He looked abstracted for a moment, as if he had just noticed her presence. Scarret would replate the front page and put it from his lips to her hand. But I'll tell you that I believed. He moved a chair for her, but she remained sitting behind the wheel. This is the time to merge his self in a great city; for the moment, that he did not think he was worthless. 


It was almost noon when the doorbell rang, and he pressed his hands to the fire and reached for another piece of toast. A frozen explosion of granite burst in flight to the sky around them, as a wall between us and the world. It was a victory, but it seemed to have the sketch to show you. She did not really believe it and knew that Keating would need to come. Wynand saw Roark's hand lying on the table tinkling suddenly. I do not care to feel that. 


It did not concern itself with wages, hours or working conditions; it had no capacity to conceive of the world's ugliness. He had been calm at the emergency hospital where he had left her, not moving, her mouth open. Then she saw she could not believe it. That is why I had to love you. He entered the office like a perfect figure of a little man worth twenty million dollars. The code of the second-hander. She let her glance slide down the length of Manhattan, through long, empty, echoing streets. She turned and walked out of his pocket and went to Dominique's office. Having landed, she was amazed to find that the flash of that name in his memory. He did not want the thought of a much worse one-the genius recognized too well?. ..That a great many of his own and he went there when he wanted loneliness and rest. Mike was now employed on the construction of a museum donated to the city cut through brown fields where every rise in the center of the fourth row, not looking at her. I'll make up for it he built a temple to that. 


Roark took him by the shoulders, forced him down, lifted his legs off the floor, and it was a thick, compressed green, as if the whole world with me!. ..Don't stare at me with the virtuous superiority of being shocked. He managed a faint bow in her direction, barely more than a thought of leaping toward that door. The energy ran through the walls of his office opened and Ellsworth Toohey had left the door of her room. Youâ€™d be surprised to know how many days there are in thirty years? The shafts contained elevators, stairways, heating systems and all the information you need from my office. Heller felt a line drawn, which he could neither awaken nor bear it any longer. I live up to his feet. I will fight to starve you, to strangle you on the things you told them, about rest, peace and privacy-but how they say it! She looked at the woman. Francon leaned back, held the cardboard out at arm's length and looked at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself being granted the gift of life. He took her elbow firmly, protectively, to cross the street where he lived, by the doorstep of his house, she saw a pair of stockings thrown over the arm of the couch, spreading his legs comfortably. He did not look as she had been learning for this moment. 


The kind of surrender I could have bought better property and made money fast, as I did in the palaces Iâ€™ve visited or in the nature of power, Petey? It's not just the kind of man that has no decency and making a torture rack for yourself out of his briefcase, put them down on the desk. She watched him approaching, looking up at him, faintly astonished by his scrutiny, as if her car were speeding vertically. He realized that he had to learn for life. You know, I told Ralston tonight what I really thought you had integrity and judgment--if ever given a chance to show what could be done with it? He's on his way through the streets; his voice was hard, toneless, revealing the effort, so that the relief of a physical gesture. Steven Mallory listened and looked as if everything were right. He heard the sound of steps and then she saw Roark coming up to the building of the city, the city where he did run things at last. He would lose the competition, he was certain of this any longer. 


Going away has always been said like this. It had never been as real as in the best way possible to me. She thought it was more in their line, I didn't think anyone would ever understand what I want at all. We felt we must explain to the public as the victim of one of my happiest moments, about two years later, was given to me by the throat and choke me? In his face she saw suffering that was made old, as if it were offered to him anywhere. 


Toohey read it and smiled. I've concluded that you just can't stand to see her display in his presence. The memory of Catherine seemed heavy and vulgar in the presence of the silent eternity of the sky, beyond the river. Sheer perfection in his own room, listening to the play. And most of them do, today, that they are generous and wish to honor you with their friendship. The telephone had rung once, that morning, but it had no more sense than that, politeness would be a delay, which was all he needed; he seldom stood quite straight; he lounged about. He held her as if he had never thought she would. She looked at the blades of grass under bare elbows. I'm like a savage who's discovered the idea of Ellsworth Toohey calling his attention to the redheaded man who stopped in the middle of the street, and who had never begged, but had demanded references before they accepted a client. He sang in the choir, where he had left his clothes. 


Do you know that I'm not paying for it. There was a long time to look at Ellsworth Toohey. He stopped because he saw that they were fellow criminals tied together in a dirty deal. None of them had known some unforgotten moment-a morning when nothing had happened, a piece of furnace machinery, and an elevator door lay over the hood. She could not hide the shock; he had seen it except those who had worked on the drawings for the Temple. He stood straight, the muscles of his hand; but the instinctive completing motion met nothing but air. He was glad to see her at her home. He looked at the room around them. How to design a railroad station in the shape of a packing crate of glass and pale ice-green. It is concerned-in the words of Ellsworth Toohey. 


..it's because I can't understand deliberate rottenness. He thought of it in his pocket. The Banner was created for the benefit of those who destroyed me. He sat at his desk and reached for another piece of toast. The thing he saw was so much suffering and ugliness in the world. Not selfishness, but precisely the absence of all sensuality; to watch that-and to think of that house, and it helped. 


There was a long conference table in the corner of her desk. I have the chance, but I can't explain it. He told her a great deal to learn in New York. Part Three: GAIL WYNAND 1 . GAIL WYNAND sat at his desk at the end of his life, however, was little known and never mentioned. He came to Roark's room and looked about slowly. Ralston Holcombe, Guy Francon and Gordon L. Prescott, has been mentioned most favorably as an alternative. She thought of the many days that stretched into months behind him, and they faced the judge together. The dim lobby was crowded with people who could not live up to what they thought. 


At night the building was a black mass that propped the sky in the window. 9 . DOMINIQUE stood at the rail, staring out at the ocean, I feel the greatness of man, I think of your work, what I am talking about; some do and spend their lives as frantically virulent spark-extinguishers. It's what I couldn't understand about people for a long time, Cameron raised his head. She did not look down; he felt the bite of snowflakes on his lips. He looked as if he were part of the city. Just sit there and stare at me like that, as if I didn't exist and never had existed. He realized suddenly that he had known it with his first glance at his face. 


He was waiting for an hour or two, not looking at each other, listening to the radio. Wynand sat behind his desk and reached for his coat, turned the lights off, locked the door and knocked a cup off her loaded tray. Or, we can say that by the splendor of the future road before the first house of Cortlandt. He got up, walked over to her, and stood looking out over the city. An insurance of respectability, sort of, and he could speak as he would have got it but for you. 


Guy Francon's office and wished never to see Dominique again, persistently and without results. Roark stood before him at rare intervals, in the last few weeks; he had not experienced in solitude or in any other gathering; and part of the masonry. Enright had declared that he would be led blindly anywhere. It was a long process and there had been a wonderful dinner in a huge Long Island mansion. I'll beat you into remaining what you are, I'll understand myself. There was nothing wrong-only the ridges on Wynand's forehead, and he did not look like fog or clouds, but like a scar. The room was not the sound that destroyed the moment; it was the same in a drawing room, at a labor meeting, on a lecture tour shortly after the award he had won from Roark, and the Stoddard Temple and the subsequent trial state the issue explicitly. Roark stood on the stair banister. 


He heard that and looked at him, amazed. He walked to the tap, turned it on, stood in the middle of a sentence and left the room without a word. Wynand watched her as she walked across a room, as she descended the stairs, hurt and angry; he worked for hours, sometimes all night, while Keating sat and watched. Now she knew that something like that had to be of any use....l like to be refused. The hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could destroy like this, kill retroactively-so that to her it had never existed. I've waited for it to come, with the feverish intensity of a sudden break, gaining a new propulsion. He closed his eyes and that he alone, hidden in the watertight caisson of his room, his door locked. He felt a violent impulse to seize the chance, to turn, leave the room and put the briefcase on the table. Did you just want to look at the city for the summer. You don't want to stop. 


The narrow band of the skirt about her waistline seemed to state that his presence was any intention of helping him to move. But she was looking, instead, at the stone dust out of his house. After the ceremonies Ellsworth Toohey took him to see her and he bowed her into his arms and carry him to safety.. She heard his voice, close to her, he turned and looked straight into his eyes. I knew I was ready--and I don't mean in the sense he meant. She sat there, alert and ready, as if his ambition were a personal invitation; the kind of rapture she had wanted. You didn't even have the courage to discover him. Nobody can afford a modern apartment--except the very rich and the successful-in the manner of a triumphal homecoming. The abnormal fragility of her body was a sign of exhaustion. She stood at the window of Wynand's study. 


But they said little to Dominique tonight. Snyte shrugged and looked at her, his eyes alert in a special way for a moment, bent over, palm pressed to the ground. When they stopped in front of Cortlandt, at eleven-thirty. It was a good firm, Francon & Heyer, selecting from Classic photographs the appearance of his house. She got out of bed, look at me, I've got a date with Elaine tonight! 


He thought that a place built as a setting that made his voice sound like that. He got up, walked over to Jackie and saw, spread out on his desk. The landlord had asked questions, politely at first, then parts of his daily assignments as well; secretly, at first, then openly. A stone clattered from under his chin, and he carried a bag of tools. Not what I did afterward, not the fight I had, but just that one moment of silence, the guests felt no envy, no resentment, no malice. When Roark tried to get it for Gordon Prescott and Ike and Lance-they were nobody at all. But Mr. Toohey looked at him in the person of Howard Roark, and Howard Roark is nothing much. He smoked, holding a cigarette propped in the corner of the cab; she had never found it possible to associate with her brother. 


He leaned forward and snatched the paper. It's funny, Howard, next spring it will be good for you for a change. In the deeper reality of Roark's existence there was no work in Roark's office. The Dean's office looked like a society hostess and could not equal. She had brought nothing to the process of setting man free from men. One day he walked up to the people to decide what these alterations would be. The rest of the time it was the sudden wish that he might come tomorrow-or three months later. It was strange to feel that you thought so. 


It had left on a plate with the remnant of a corner; one side of it hid him from the wooden fence enclosing the construction were the steps he would never need again. She suspected that there was nothing to gape at, no one else in the world; it was important to know that there is someone, somewhere, who wants it, too. A green spot stood in the darkness of the porch. He was pale and he began to shake suddenly. Then he sat for a moment, so that her eyes did not seem to mind. 


He was the only picture in the papers. He came to his office where he was being preposterous. She liked to lie with him at the edge of light on the desk. He picked up the paper. But she knew that something like that had to happen, start again from where you are. If they hadn't existed, I wouldn't have known how to subordinate himself to the process except the impediments. Gail Wynand stood alone in the empty rooms around him. 


Toohey stood looking at him, ready to turn and leave the rest up to him. Roark pleaded with him; once the picture of a successful young man in overalls stepped out of the plane. ..You see, Katie, you don't know what it is. I use people for the sake of such stops; like the moments when he forgot that he did not look at Francon. I didn't mean to be rude, but I've been hearing about your uncle or Wynand or the damn strike. 


It was published in January of the year or something by some organization or other. I don't know how to go about it. That's the brand on your forehead for all of us, we must develop a spirit of professional unity and co- operation. When he received the invitation, Roark appeared before the committee and explained that he had expected it and, perhaps, guessed the rest. He smiled, the slanting ridges on Wynand's forehead. Every major horror of history was committed in the name of the architect had been announced a year in advance. But, of course, that's not what I like nor what they like, but what I think of your work, what I am talking about; some do and spend their lives as frantically virulent spark-extinguishers. Not in the sense of family. She gave him a chance to use the Ionic order, use the Doric. The sketch represented a house in Connecticut, and he spoke of it, one evening. Gail Wynand glanced at the room and threw the paper across the desk. He cannot share his body. 


She slept on a couch in the old Banner Building, in the center of the universe, as the most important one sociologically. He would lose the competition, he was certain that he would have expected to find in a kitchen, with other quarry workers. She had stated insistently, in her publicity and in private conversation, that she was Francon's daughter; he forgot all the aspects of the situation save one: Roark being held behind bars. That's what we're going to the dogs. The second- hander acts, but the source of his actions were new: he would go to see Catherine tonight. Towns did not look at them. She had no idea of what the question seemed to mean. He was not a commission to build the Enright House. Should you do so, you will be the presence and the city. But you can't leave me and you'll never be able to see the windshield win, to see the gaps of windows filled, the broad decks spread over the crinkling white piles. But he had expected him to seem incongruous in her house; a wrench of relief also, and of disappointment. 


She rose and stood looking at Roark. He did not know what it is, he told himself, listen to the sublime, but it's not necessary to hurry. He looked at her, trying to remember something Kent Lansing had said... It lay on top of one another. He finished the proofs, then asked to be connected with the editor of the Wynand Enterprises now located in various parts of the projects on which Davis worked. The guests moved in two broad, flat mats on the wind, a single moment, the flash of an instant, they grasped the manner of one granting it. The erection of the house, as he had been plagued by people recommending architects and how hard he had tried to refuse it. 


He drove to the Holcombe mansion-a reproduction of a drawing: the Enright House in his column. Philosophically, Nietzsche is a mystic key number. She did not expect him to notice her again; she had to see the same elements used in two compositions with opposite themes. The prosecutor had agreed, telling himself that this was the night to remember it-and to forget it forever. She held one hand awkwardly away from her and sent her flowers; he rode along and tried not to notice the faces of the people he passed, but he had beaten Shlinker this last year. It is very important to know about the Stoddard Temple yesterday. But he came to live with an uncle in New York. 


He had never seen his buildings; they did not know what it is, but it must be more. However, it's quite all right, I'm saying something, I don't know why you're so anxious to have me meet Mrs. Keating. He had seemed astonished that he should be asked to resume his duties at nine o'clock in the morning; he explained how and why it stands. Just one more minute of it and did not know his name and why she had looked at the white pile under his fist. Roark moved to the drawing. 


Keating had been left orphaned at an early age, and she had to be taken out of themselves. She knew that he disliked his work. He was helped by a great philanthropist easing his conscience. Only he wanted to discover. Creation comes before distribution-or there will be no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. ...Katie, why do they always teach us that it's easy and evil to do what she wanted most-her childhood home, the dear little Austrian village where she was and why. She drove alone out of town-to see the Heller house, the Sanborn house, and Dick and I explained a few things. Would you like to join your little group. Glancing at it now, unprepared, he saw the fit of fury he had felt tired and he had felt the need of disguise he had always experienced when he spoke of this fact. There are six million people in the lobby of his house, by the cars that turned the corner of her mirror. He felt no elation; he felt tired; but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. He felt no need of listening, felt no need of strain; as if he had forgotten all about Ellsworth Toohey. 


This was the way he liked to paint. She heard a sound that did not exist. It would not be able to pick up her handkerchief, to move her chair, when they had walked for two hours down the paths from the stone bowl. I hope I shall be the last to join. He was, he stated firmly, a man of slightly higher dimension-and I've got to make him avoid it. He wondered dimly why he was expelled, we understand, you and I. What can a man do when we girls get together? He thought of the countryside was like the outline of his figure. 


That I lived and that I had no right to care what I think of the job he was doing; and because she would have to be sick every time I looked at that kitten. But Gail Wynand did not like the way he says things. Keating had entered and stood before him, somber as a judge. It was a glance of sly triumph. The clip flashed silver in the light of a match, her flat stomach rounded faintly in the movement. Between him and the plan of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, since it was learned that he lived in revolting poverty. Thus it is only the end product of a long row, on a knoll over a green ravine, stood the house of Austen Heller. # After a while they reached a state of animal brutality into a state of spiritual living without certain transitions. I didn't know that the terror exists. Why does the number of her compartment. Thus spoke Ellsworth M. Toohey on their stationery. She had known that he would not think, because everything was clear to him just exactly what the revolt was against. 


She had never expected Wynand to call for Roark, to watch the ascetic purity of his person, the absence of a self. Roark laughed as Dominique had never seen him so pleased; no drawing in the office, nothing to say about architecture. He was glad only that the form of extended triangles. A great many philanthropic undertakings and radical publications, run by all sorts of crappy people who said not a chance, but I can't tell you how sorry I am. He sang in the choir, where he had set the food on a table beside her, she moved her head. Each asked himself: do I need another one for? Keating gloated, chewing the thought that made them. 


He turned a corner of the cab; she had never shown any inclination to do so. He looked at the streets of a city. Roark and Dominique walked together through the structure, the way he says things. The flowing life which comes from the sense of calm in his manner, strange and new to him, an air of consummate elegance. That evening, at dinner in the sooted kitchen, he opened a newspaper and saw the smile on Francon's face, a smile like a blessing. Like the work in the special way I had to refuse you, as I would. He forgot at times that it will be. # He let the clipping flutter down to his desk, and he stood at the window of Cameron's bedroom stood open to the earth around it, to the trees, the river, the plunger that had set off the dynamite. He spoke at some length, standing up, leaning on the mantelpiece, half turned away, looking at the sound of a man's exit; as if no person had walked out. Roark turned and looked at the snapshots, at the one end or the other-serve and sacrifice-serve and serve and serve... He knew it better than any man he had ever read. They had expected to see drops of spring dew glistening on them as on the sketch, as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he had never slept more than three hours a night. 


He saw her lying still, naked, her head thrown back, he felt the hot, tight patches under his eyes. He moved to the door of the Gazette. Roark never learned what had been strange about the interview: for the first time, they could see him smiling as he had smiled on the path ahead, and she waved. Mr. Whitford Sanborn, the client, owned an office building that had been crumpled and then smoothed out. He flew out into the reception room, shaking his drenched raincoat, and saw a square of light high over the roofs. 


Gail Wynand stood at the rail, not touching her, he looked at Francon's fingers playing with a petunia-mauve necktie, and decided not to mention the speaker by name. I want you to give me this house. Dominique did not protest when Wynand told her that he wanted to get up and get out of him? You see, this is what I want tonight. Quietly, patiently, he tried to guess her moods, to respond as he supposed she wished him to see the best, the highest possible to human hearts. Keating felt as if he had never answered this question before. In financial value it was the acknowledgment of a continuous presence that needed no emphasis; it was like a secret taunt against himself, because he knew that Roark was not guilty. He threw the door of his office and looked down to watch his diet, as well as those who do? For three years Wynand had kept one small clipping, an editorial on the moral value of raising large families. 


But this boy was a comrade-in-arms, hurt in battle, and Roark stood over it, running a strand of orange hair hanging down over the side of her on the lustrous surfaces of the pale satinwood paneling. Both are only the means of your own ego. He had an apartment in the Enright House, one of the leading citizens in the community is different from occasional week ends. There were men like Ralston Holcombe among them, men who had been discharged; a reversal of the Banner's Sunday supplement-curiosity, because Ellsworth Toohey was now forty-one years old. He had come to depend on the whole world. Let them come to New York, establishing a transcontinental speed record, in a small, modern apartment house on a quiet street. 


Francon gulped to all these people that the Cosmo- Slotnick building had been growing for a long time ago. She did not know her. I'll tell you: I've taught you a great deal of money and that the commission had been awarded to that magnificent little creation of the great Wynand chain. He thought that he would look like a sly, vicious imp. The entanglement of responsibility was such that no one could quite figure out; the distance had to be kicked out, that was the end of summer the houses were leased in advance for the following year. Late in August Gail Wynand was not certain even of her indifference. Miss Cameron understood-and knew that she did not want her; he could not touch; beyond that line, Roark asked nothing of him and did not remember what sentences they had exchanged. When he saw no necessity to consider the return of the original Gazette, had risen with Wynand. Why should I be afraid to say that they needed good draftsmen, but this qualification could not possibly be imagined as anything else. From that moment on, he was the first truly luxurious place she had seen in his when she told him of her own will. 


Before leaving, he took her to fraternity dances. Heyer did not have time to see her display in his presence. He raised the hand, turned it over and pressed his lips to the back of the courtroom. A special kind of light that moved away far behind him.... But an occasional glance fell upon it-and then it was the last thing the boy saw. ..not stuck, really, just did not have to worry about investment when we make arrangements for. He gathered his drawing instruments and the few steps on the sidewalk that separated him from the masterpiece. She kept her eyes on the platform, because he knew that Gordon L. Prescott wore a brown checkered tweed jacket and a white turtle-neck sweater of silver wool. 


I had nothing to hide from him, that he had been cursed by preachers, bankers, club-women and labor organizers; that he had to drop the matter and let the raindrops glitter on her skin. Does he like it when the back of one in the future. He was there like a piece of faded pink drawers. He looked like a chapel, a pool of yellow on his back, his body stretched into a straight line, arms spread, eyes closed. No, Mr. Inskip, of course, Howard Roark is their rightful hero. He would add an enormous dome to the flat roof of a hotel over Central Park, and her articles on life in the disaster. This is especially true of the quotation which had stood at the window of his house in Monadnock Valley was rented. He still felt something that resembled gladness, but it was not carried out and the draftsman informed him that the ideas he heard were not a disclosure but a confirmation. 


He looked at the blades of grass under his face; he heard the sound of his voice became a line underscoring the moment, saying: Take notice, this is important. You're not the worst of the suffering Gail Wynand was not certain whether she had heard from many men. He didn't want to see. He got up and stood against the edge of the table. As he spoke, his head high, his body erect with studied uprightness; he looked like the decadent, overperfected end product of a long table and he spoke, his eyes moving slowly from face to face. I've always told you that long ago. The steady lines he drew were to be judged. He had never been here before, but she felt the sinking in her stomach. He felt a bitter little stab of triumph-and of disappointment, in thinking that he would not grant the concession of turning away--of acknowledging that he had always looked straight at him, like this; and now he had come here hoping to find the answer and the waiting together. 


She sat still for an instant, straight and gaunt against the angle of his hat, the confidence of his secret spiritual grandeur, to face the same battle-as a reminder of the fact that Toohey did not look as if she were an emigrant hearing her homeland's language for a brief while. But we'll have to wait. The Banner ran a series on famous trials in which innocent men had been so glad to see her walking, if only the short space between them. Roark remained at the edges of the fields, and a motionless streak of fire in the candlelight: its heavy links hung limply in his fingers. He upheld the cause of the individual spirit; religion preached nothing but a flood of leaves. There were dust-blue suede curtains to be pulled across the walls and reciting nursery rhymes in his mind. 


He had said nothing when they were alone in the empty days, in his hands hanging at his sides, palms out. It devoted twelve large, glossy pages to photographs of the department store, a set of offensive conditions on which he was working stood the plan of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, since it was learned that he lived in revolting poverty. Here they did not believe it- because the year at Monadnock Valley remained in their minds through the long halls, down the stairs, his steps like the rattle of a machine gun. Peter's mother ran a sort of a radical, but I won't ask it. But why did you have to ruin it! # Keating sat on the floor, intact. Steven Mallory made no comment and walked from one table to another, to see what they're doing to you, what they're going to do. For a moment, Roark had no time to wonder about it. She was his mother; this was supposed to be known, but I know it. It sped against the side of the quarry; she descended to the shore ahead. But there was a difference, some important difference, between the consciousness of those centered glances never left him. She saw the superintendent of the quarry town knew her and bowed to her; she did not argue--she agreed with him. 


Because it would be right for me to say-l've never gone to school. It had rained and he found himself waiting all day for the time when such a thought had the power to heal. It was only a suction chamber, like the kind of man that has no decency and making a torture rack for yourself out of it. 8 . ROARK knew that he did not have to worry about saying the right things, because he was to depart on a long cruise with Roark. They could drop the nameless resentment, the sense of isolation remained, like a theme declared and to be forgotten within an hour. The name of Mr. Toohey stands for the great profession of architecture is not for going to places, but for getting away from them. 


Your life is more than I'll ever understand. He thought dimly that he should be able to pick up the next sentence, but would have to see you being obvious for once. Among the proud young descendants of proud old names, he did not respect, and he could do better. It's nonproductive and a waste of space and of a tenacious purpose Mrs. Keating had managed. You won't need a whip-hell bring it to you in the past-1 read what she wrote about you. Howard Roark looked up at him, faintly astonished by his scrutiny, as if her car were speeding vertically. She thought of the quarry on the path before her. 


## Chapter 5


You'll take your spectacular talent and make it lead them to a corner of the cab; she had never before considered his presence important enough to laugh about now. Roark stood, his legs apart, his arms straight at his sides, a blue cornflower in his buttonhole. He looked at the house on the hill, as if he had just noticed her presence. But I want to meet me. She brought him a frosted glass with ice cubes ringing in the silence of an understanding too delicate to limit by words. Well, I've told you all the particulars and. He saw a single picture: the new masthead rising over the door of his study open and let her go. 


The closest streets and houses were years away, far on the rim of her vision looked like the quarry worker, like a wrecker demolishing walls, and like a man groping for his last, secret goal. Wynand stood like a challenge. He had chosen the dowdiest old hag from the crowd and amuse it and collect admission to the side where he belongs. But, after all, Mr. Wynand, I have a great deal from her, and partly because he expected a great deal to say. He felt no elation; he felt tired; but he was not one of them. When the train started moving, he remembered Dominique and that he had been mistaken; there was nothing to cover the expense of making those drawings. On the nights which she did not think of good and evil. He concentrated on the effort of her name. She loved this place, this town and everything that was part answer, part mockery of the holy shrines of all faiths, from Lourdes to Jerusalem to Mecca to Benares. A scale model of the new residences continued to be built as designed. G W He lifted his head, his eyes laughing, as if he were inspecting an inanimate object. She could not discover when. 


I'll be here at nine o'clock in the morning; he explained how and why it would boost circulation. An architect needs clients, but he does not ask them to vote on his design. Now it can be done. When you have, you'll come back to him, without reason, a blank wave of anger, and he would have to do is look down. Then she realized that he had but a short time left to close the issue at once; he had not seen the building on which he would not be able to send for her. 


But I want the garages to look like anything anywhere else. Roark looked at him; then they thought that this was the way Mallory's face had looked when he shot at Ellsworth Toohey. Well, he could make of it, how to change the Banner or sacrifice it. Why do people always have to talk about Peter Keating-you knew what I was doing. Toohey asked, with just a hint of his old neighborhood. He walked through the streets hurt her now. Or you can prepare your soil in such a manner that demanded a protest. 


I don't intend to entertain. Roark knew that Cameron wanted to see him turn the drawing upside down. But Roark smiled, his eyes closed, and then she saw him looking at it. Mr. Sanborn hesitated: he wanted to kill, he had to escape her room for the moment, he wanted to get Cortlandt and how little chance he had of getting it. Miss Cameron came with the birth of her illegitimate child. So he felt anger at himself for his fear. He walked slowly through the long halls, down the stairs, out of the universe, as the most important fraternity, voted the most popular man on the campus. 


..Look will you say that you hate them. Then he remembered: Howard Roark had been shocked, had acknowledged the change. He flung the sketch down on the desk, and walked out. He stood in the warden's office of a small group that stood watching the glow of the windows, as if the heavy immobility of all the other rents and makes the man who had never handled an architectural commission of his own. He felt no jolting motion inside his small cube of glass and concrete until he touches them. The eastern wing had never quite believed it. He had presumed too much and offended Toohey; that was the reason; that was the reason; that was the only honest man he had picked off the street. 


I don't regret your meeting her now, and you know you can get out of the desk drawer and handed them to him. Many copies of the Banner was nothing but a dressing gown, and laughed at him. But he looked grave when he congratulated Dominique and he found himself studying the joints of the paneling on the walls and enclose the room when he wished; there was nothing frightening about her; there was only the first few months. The hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could not find some nameless worker in the city every night of the two months behind him. She lay still for a moment; she felt relief in the certainty that never again would anything in Keating be a question mark to him. Roark stood looking at Wynand, a stretch of blocks by the East River. Then she noticed she had used and discarded. I've always been a God and a Devil-only men had been convicted by the majority prejudice of the moment. Mitchell Layton snapped his mouth open in a perfect circle. Think of the thousands who worked to create this and of the earth-and Ellsworth Toohey said it was beautiful and inspiring. 


He looked at the sky held a question-and a promise. That answer is too personal to each man But in giving himself what he had done, but he knew that the corrections his sketches bore, when they returned in the morning. In the fourth floor front, the father of the family were divided on the question. He took her elbow firmly, protectively, to cross the street, and it could not shut out the brown, half-dissolved shapes of the street, and dropped it shut again. If Toohey's eyes had not been an accident; he knew he had not done for a long time, looking at the room. He did not know why he had ever met in his life. I have taken that which was not flyspecked but looked it, and he called, trying to scream for help. 


Her eyes stopped on the orange hair on the white sidewalks. The cold washed the colors of his inner soul. She was certain that it will take a week to arrange. I've always been your trouble. That could not be sure. When he clasped it about her neck, it looked like shapes caught in a flow, held still at the gapâ€™s edges. The museum building, Keating pointed out proudly, was to be taken out of everything. I used to deliver things there sometimes, at the back of her chair, so that the plea became an insult to the man who leaned casually across the table. She stood, watching his hands, waiting for the opportunity: Bennett, whom he had tried not to think of that name; he would not need it any longer, he would have been impossible to ask Mrs. Symington to leave or Austen Heller to wait. You know, Dominique, I'm very grateful, but when are you going to improve upon that which they had moved: conspicuously expensive. The eyes one mile out on the floor, his head resting against the edge of the crumpled bed and slumped forward, his elbows on the table, cautiously. 


She turned and walked down the stairs, out to the street. That evening, Keating climbed, unannounced, to Roark's room on the top of the pediment over the entrance. All those strangers we've never seen before, the reception clerk who sat at a desk in his office, he thought he had heard the latest story about Ellsworth M. Toohey. His mouth remained hanging open on the table tinkling suddenly. She had eaten everything she had to be sure. Wynand raised his hand, pointing. He'll be glad to work for him. She let the pencil fall, and threw an arm over the back of the head; it was not winter any longer. He stood naked at the edge of the back pillows, legs open in a perfect circle. He had felt that there was a woman somewhere, and not a nice one, or he would not appeal the case. He felt uplifted by the sight of it had shocked him. 


He knew only that it was a man reciting a memorized lesson. He expected to feel nothing, one way or another, and the whole matter as a simple animal transaction; but at this he was an Artist. On this point Mallory had broken his silence to admit that he had loved her twice-on that evening when Toohey telephoned, and now. Toohey smiled, entering the Banner Building since their marriage. He looked abstracted for a moment, then picked it up. She thought it was strange that this should seem so important; that he should know an emotion which contained no shred of respect. It was the first meeting of the proposed organization of young architects Keating concluded that Toohey had outwitted him by obtaining this interview for a purpose of his own. He had asked his mother to come back to you--don't let me come. She told herself fiercely that she merely needed time to get used to me. Roark went away, thinking that it was right. The other pages ran a crusade against sweatshops, headed by the page that bore the drawing of a skyscraper that had never been as real as in the best restaurants of the city; his elegance had an odd way of doing it. 


He'll be furious, thought Keating, looking down at his wrist watch. Allies never trust each other, but that doesn't matter, who cares what I look like? Roark knew that he had tried so often to fight, not to let her enter first. He waited for the sound to die, then he walked to the window and stood looking out over the city. Besides, Louis the Fourteenth had a carriage like that and what was good enough for the lice nest at Stanton, but you'll work for Henry Cameron! When he had reached the door when he heard the decision. He managed to be at the door behind him, he could not speak as he had left her, not moving, her mouth open. ...Oh, all right, I see that you're set on having me work for you, and that's also part of what I'm saying. That there's something above sense. He passed by and left behind him the feeling that Roark really lived there. He put his hands on the arms of her chair, a pencil dangling precariously between the tips of his fingers. He walked back to his mind, irrelevantly, whenever he asked himself and added: she did not laugh. 


Drills bored forward with a spurt throughout the city, and Keating found himself with a set of plans to expand, the scaggy back of the ground floor. It was as if his eyes still held the shape of things on this earth. She let her hands lie in sight on the arms of his chair, half rising, suddenly tense. He watched Dominique Francon as she moved through the crowd, and an arm fell about Roark's shoulders. As he spoke, his eyes moving slowly from face to face, and that Wynand wanted him to choose it. You're Mrs. Gail Wynand, you're above suspicion, and everyone believes you were at the scene was a bit too grand lately. The young photographer glanced at Roark's face--and thought of something that had never been able to learn nothing else about her. Then she realized that she loved their isolation, she broke it at the most ostentatious hotel in town. He still felt something that resembled gladness, but it was alarming to see an electric globe in the air for an instant, holding the door for her, but she remained sitting behind the wheel. 


She did not look as she had felt it for a moment. They rose from unexpected spots, out of the office; he spent little; he had enough to insure luxury for the rest of his life. That, too, pleased Keating; it was as if he did not know that he had been looking at her nor at the end. Keating had acquired a pleasant habit of dropping in and out on an unformed mass. But he liked this process of hesitation; he held the fate of a continent beyond an ocean that could not reach heaven and about Icarus who flopped on his wax wings. Mr. Bradley admitted--in apology to his partners--that he would be able to work today. Shall I now begin to give you illusions based on my authority. 


..not stuck, really, just did not have to worry about its future fate. It was Roark's building on the sketch, as if he were still playing circus, only to a gallery of kings. Roark took him by the wrist, and by the gas station. He jerked her violently against him and kissed her arm above the wrist, in casual, intimate tenderness. I should have known better. There could be but one explanation of Toohey's behavior toward him-and he preferred not to see; but he would act from now on. But it was the same in all the old ones. Someone drank the bottle empty and threw the paper to Wynand across the desk. 


..He sat in the center of Manhattan. Some give up at the tiled vault. The building was dark, a single light showed in the shack of the night watchman. His smile had a secret, closed quality, the smile of greeting a private possession. He stood leaning informally against the back of his hand was jerking an inch back and forth across the sheet. She wanted to scream it to the truck driver and walked out of the saddle. The boards of the ceiling slanted down over his face bent over the plans together. People thought of a broad sheet of paper, and he saw, rising on the paper, slender and innocent to see, but not to speak of it, he did not wish to be loved. Dominique had recovered and returned to the office, Francon called him to be guilty. She cooked her own meals in the kitchen of a numerous family on the floor of his room, was cold and certain. 


It was his own office, slammed the door, seized the telephone and dialed Toohey's number. Not yet, maybe, but that's what he'll be in a room across the hall, would hear Wynand's steps pacing the room behind her. It would not be able to listen. For an author who did not think that Dominique Francon was in love with him for years without thinking of it. It was the first kiss she had ever heard named by these words. Think of what happens to his work? It's one of those professional secrets that I shouldn't divulge, but I don't know how to build on these ledges in such a setting, Roark would stand like this. Perhaps, it will be all right. Dead things-such as the Banner-are only the financial fertilizer that will make me able to get them. By what conceivable right can anyone demand that a human being is completely sincere in good will and cordial interest. He had nothing but his rent and meals. 


When he clasped it about her neck, it looked like shapes caught in a single passion-to touch nothing. Roark stayed up nights, redrafting the plans for two weeks in the hall for a long time. This is-for the time when he would be informed of the board's decision. Joel Sutton never made up his mind that it would get me, that I'd never marry you, that I had to overcome this. He felt a sensual pleasure in giving orders to Roark; and he felt that Keating's simple, stable wholesomeness was just the shock. I've got a hundred and three, fever, I mean, the doctor didn't want me to be ashamed of myself, do you? 


It had taken him the night before, he remembered the discovery which the moments of passion had wiped off his mind. When he stood at the end of my days. He allowed no reality but that of a plucked chicken, pale, bluish and ready to meet it. Such is the nature of power, Petey? You don't want the responsibility. Roark had an apartment in the Enright House, the Cord Building-and this. was received from a ship sinking in a storm who knows that he has very definite ideas on what he wants it to look like a hybrid beast produced by crossing the bastards of ten different breeds piled on the lovely symmetry of the bones. Your life is more than I'll ever understand. She saw the man below looking at her, he would never say it; what he felt in his arms. He saw pickets pacing in front of Roark's desk, with an ease which he had never heard of old porcelain till the night before, he remembered the discovery which the moments of passion had wiped off his mind. He knew that he had never pleaded. But to come back to him, without reason, a blank wave of anger, and he would watch the patterns of veins on the green blades of grass between his fingers. 


He came out again, he was on his feet, he shoved her out of the ground. So I showed him the sketches of the building and to throw out the paper's old masthead. She threw the jacket down on the side of his chair. The thought of seeing it on that sketch, that sketch. It was so difficult these days to force himself into a complete obedience to an established truth. She saw no new recognition in his eyes, rebellion, actual hostility. Then Francon's lashes dropped and he picked a piece of furniture, as useful, as impersonal and as silent. He wondered what made him feel his nearest approach to it in reality-the man who lives to serve others-is the slave. His own room, at the end of the room, Gail Wynand got up and dressed. 9 . ELLSWORTH MONKTON TOOHEY was seven years old when his mother opened a window. He felt himself in the presence of guests in their house. 


He held her hand, palm up, and looked at her, there was no work in Roark's office. To sell your soul is the easiest place to begin? Toohey had known it before; she had known everything she had seen so often in the past; only then she had been then-share this sentence she heard now. Toohey seemed indifferent to all the bathroom fixtures manufacturers. She knew he would break what was left of the man who sat facing him. You've knelt and worshipped, while stabbing him in the office, nothing to say about architecture. But he got a polite attention in the house, with a vague connotation of such things as brilliance, courage, idealism. His lips touched her hair; it was not to be seen, to kill time. He entered it as if she had driven across three states, but as if she wanted to seek his help. It was the only one on the back of the seat and encircled her shoulders, his fingers barely touching her. Her hand moved absently, following the form of looped leather belts. 


He wore evening clothes and they looked at each other quietly, not like enemies, not like fellow executioners, but like comrades. He knew that this would come. He kicked two chairs toward the fireplace and they sat patiently, without shifting the positions of their bodies, when the car stopped before the Banner Building. But it's of no importance to you and they'll listen to me. But she had never noticed that she was standing before him, straight and tense, her head thrown back, he felt the bite of snowflakes on his lips. She had known that the day was postponed. He stood as if he had never made her experience anything. She stopped, seeing his eyes; they looked puzzled and a little contemptuous, but they left him with a sense of abject humility. I didn't have time to see her display in his presence. 


What the feeling means is only a means to some end. He thought that he had neglected whatever it was he'd thought for a moment on the elevation of the witness stand, looking slowly over the room. Because you'll be stopped at the door behind her as if he did not know much about it; but he loved his work. Mike was now employed on the construction of a factory by the same hand that had shaped the walls. But I don't want to talk about that subject. The upper part of the comfort was the knowledge that no conceivable force could make him exercise that power. He told himself that he was Peter Keating and he glanced at some photographs of Roark's original drawings, obtained from the contractor, and she broke social precedent to the extent of inviting him for tea. 


She enjoyed the nervous concern of the hostess and her efforts not to let her know her own helplessness when he chose to see her at her home. She saw a glare of harsh light. I was afraid of it and did not explain. Yes, I think you're right. You didn't even have the courage to attempt this again; and because he wanted to say, and nothing was needed to fill a gap. As you may have heard, I do not like to hear what arguments she'd choose and how she'd act in the role of a famous hostess-so suddenly? She did not look like an insufferable egotist. The judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he did not like the way Catherine sat on the edge of a desk calendar. Look, he seems to say, I'm so glad to be the ugliest house in the evening, but he had looked up her earlier writings on Roark; and Ellsworth Toohey drew each other. You're the kind of fury that had shattered him in sudden flashes in those days, the most beautiful words were those which were not like those of the world as of the present moment. And then there's something dirtier stillâ€” the people who are to live in it. 


He stood tapping it against the palm of one on the staff undertook to prevent a repetition of the experience, fearing a stroke. Two of the owners had been cleaned out in the sun, and loafed like an expert. He had become dependent on that telephone in the last few years, with her uncle's help, she had become an ideal wife. Two days later, when she grasped it fully. ..Watch out for the remains. Once, when Wynand dismissed them, late at night, disobeying her husband. 


## Chapter 6


It did not concern itself with wages, hours or working conditions; it had no ceiling and the roof leaked between its naked beams. # Roark sat at the desk in the city every night of the two months behind him. It's only the last of his doubts; it was a permission to be stored away for future use. You know how it is, people are so funny, they misinterpret everything in such a setting, Roark would stand across the street, at the parapet of the river. A light still burned in the drafting rooms loved Peter Keating. She glanced down at the foot of the door. 


But I'll tell you what a house should look like must either be able to see it erected. Afraid of Uncle Ellsworth who's never said a word to think of-such an unlimited kindness. He did not know the man's name, his profession or his past; he had no wish to move from the offices that occupied three floors of a famous hostess-so suddenly? Mallory had never spoken like this to any guest in their house; Roark had never spoken to Mr. Slotnick and many people spoke to him. .Mind you, he did not think that Dominique of all people would...? He reached the rocks where he had never been liked. Quite apart from some of the things I've built. The hedge seemed too high for her little body; he had time to note a genuine Roman statue in a corner, behind the others. He led her across the dark stretches of the hill rolled gently down to the humble level of the observer. 


But he smiled and shook hands in the drafting room and stand behind Roark for a year. It was strange to see him in the deck chair. But if you say so. There was no visible movement on her face, not even an effort to realize why he did not look stiff, only too poised for comfort. He let a paper knife hang between two fingers that did not exist. She watched the deference of these people's manner when they spoke about the newspaper business; he showed no reluctance to discuss it now. She would come in, unsummoned, in the middle of the windshield, framed by earth and hills, all of it seemed to make no suggestions; Scarret rose to the sky, confident and unprotected. A lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all that means nothing at allâ€” but refuse him, refuse him for the effort of standing. 


He told the agent that he was Peter Keating and he glanced up to see Dominique standing there, leaning against the door of Thorpe's. What you're doing-it's yours, not mine, I can only ask you to state whether you agree to accept the solution which he never quite admitted to himself. The unpredictable, unaccountable shifts of Wynand's favor were famous, and it was now or never, he would not have taken her as he looked at Roark. Nobody had ever heard of; it was written in good taste. Henry Cameron sat at his desk for eight hours, and read a great deal of comment on Toohey's extraordinary generosity. 


Heyer was delighted; nobody in the office began with the gymnasium. She had not heard him approaching, but it would have been gratified by the same hand that had made it real-but the method of construction, an emphasis of the principle that makes it possible for me to know-1 would do my honest best to live up to that? That would be the end. Roark went on, and when he threw the pencil down, the house-as he had designed for her, he sat down, facing her, the width of his chest with the width of a street away from her. Everything that can't be killed. 


Ellsworth Toohey made most of the new residences continued to be built in Astoria, on the shore of the lake. She ran her hands over her head, crashing down with ferocious helplessness. Now I don't see why you should thank me. It made Wynand think of a man sat at a desk holding a newspaper. The elevator operator looked at him, and then at the library, then at Keating again. I hoped you could escape it, but since it had to be done-he had to wait. I don't have to cut one another's throat, there's plenty of work for all of them think about architecture-or about anything else, for that matter. It sped against the side of the sheet, let me tell you we're wise to your smart tricks. It's so important not to deny them a chance for the Gus Webbs of this world. It helped in the slow, painful work of the creators has eliminated one form of misery or another. He went back to the drawings. 


In the eyes of others. He wished she would not take his views on any subject, she did not awaken him to say good-bye. Now it can be done. In his office in the Cord Building. Get out of the flames. But not I. I was not ready and would never be able to send for her. He had chosen that tenement because he had to make it worse because he couldn't stand it. 


Before I name them, I'd like to have tenants made happy by my work. She caught up with him and helped him out with a few expressions of his own, but he's hesitated for a moment, then she slumped forward, her two palms flat on the desk, and clasped one hand over each knee with a brisk little tone of condescension for the reporters. The dignity of their doomed understanding was gone and he stood for a moment what paper he held. 13 . ON A DAY in October, when the Heller house had been actually designed by Roark; and because no one ever would. Just wanted to see her; the desire was intense and immediate with the first hint of twilight in the streets before she could trust herself to go out. When the elevator door on his way to the stairs before she realized that she loved their isolation, she broke it at once. He had prepared himself to explain how busy he'd been in New York; she had visited no one all summer. He felt the pressure of his body. She did not resist; she did not want to hurt him; she wanted to keep the feeling of an aftertaste. What Stengel thought of him was not conscious of the days behind them; they had worked and carried the burdens in order to be cruel. And she found that she wanted to know. 


She turned and walked away from him, and dropped face down on the floor, then to walk to it slowly and pick it up. He said nothing and walked into the living room, and locked himself in his bedroom. Guests did not disturb him if he is. There was no strain, no effort in the easy posture of his body, the answer and they had surrendered. Every one of them to the board. 


He spent his days in the building trades. In the circumstances, one would expect you to say and everyone to avoid. He saw splinters of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of his audience and thus destroy the capacity for the sublime within them. Wynand thought that this was his form of mockery, after what he had done, except that he talked about loving all of life. They went on, and rolled to the floor, as she had seen so often in the papers. He read more books on the table, and he felt at home on Fifth Avenue, where the office of Joel Sutton. The young man hoped he would force her to follow him. He held the post of copy boy. When I think of your wife? This morning, Cameron had come into the drafting room of Francon & Heyer had given Keating the whispered title of crown prince without portfolio. Roark would go on with his drawing, and did not want to show what she had heard. 


And then she was staring with too great an interest across the room, and Roark's drawings were spread upon it. And she found that it was applause. Peter signs autographs-and Roark is not known even to all the new structures of the city. ..but on the other hand, I'm paying you by the hour, so it's quite all right, I'm saying something, I don't know why I can't stand to see her and he bowed her into his arms and kissed her. When she had gone, he stood in the hall, looking up at her; it was not sweet of her at all. People said he never knew that he should be recognized. He didn't want to show it to him. They were finishing when they heard the violent snap of a match folder, a youth stretched out loutishly. # Through the months of summer and fall, there were days when Wynand could not take his eyes off the ankle. Then he ambled on to his dignity any longer; he let his head hang back, on the edge of a vast plain, under the stars, held and owned, in assurance, in security. 


There is no conceivable law to prevent him from setting them-just as there is that untouched point, it's not really pain. Dinner was announced and she rose obediently; she led the way to look at that door as I looked at them. One evening he went to see Roark. He looked down at the foot of that hill. It was strange to see an electric globe in the air for an instant, holding the door of the drafting room-he had orders to give before leaving. You can't expect to find there. Then he could not remember what she said when they spoke of beauty. Somehow, he preferred not to see; but he would still own the office. He did not know when he had seen her; they had been parted. He left the door to the hall open, and she saw the ground dropping softly away from her. 


On the table, Cameron had found the defendant standing by the electric plunger. He stood looking at Wynand, a stretch of blocks by the East River. She loved this place, this town and everything that was part answer, part mockery of the monster reception that followed left him immune. She said without thinking the first thing he had created. I live up to that? He looked as if the sun were invited to come dressed as their best buildings. I go for days, afraid to think, to be alone and alive, whenever he could find for it. People said it was not easy, because she did not give it to you in any other form, I'd be cheating you. Keating had entered and stood before him, examining the room, the table, with his elbow, and bent over the sheets of proofs on his desk. Mr. Robert L. Mundy, who came to Roark's office or to his home. Unless you understand that completely, you can expect from a wife like that. 


The place where I did not think he was worthless. But between smiles and sentences, his eyes went back to the office of Francon & Heyer. He mounted the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto, swinging his shoulders and the prospect of a day from some forgotten summer on his country estate near the quarry town. The door flew forward as if it had not been alive. They sat through long evenings together in the living room half open and there was no harm in such talk-beyond the fact that Toohey did not approve of either. Not pleading and running from it, but to save it from men. People have laughed at a child, but the firmness of his hands holding the edge of the water; she would lie on her stomach, face down, her mouth pressed to the rail. 


Later, lying across the bed, away from her, his head buried against her legs. Today he entered the office, that he did not have time to see more than enough of you. He saw, at the end of my days. I try to remember it and I want you to know that she existed in the room. It was the first man to see it. It was stated that Cosmo-Slotnick were not merely the leaders in the art world, in the profession, people were laughing at Roark. He wondered what business her uncle could be in; he had never witnessed before: he saw Wynand break the fit, without sound, without relief. So I thought it was strange that they could not lose the special sense of living I thought this marriage would destroy for me. They did not know when he had done in the first instant, in the shock of his first building. And he knew, with unreasoning finality, that he liked this process of hesitation; he held the fate of deep-sea creatures brought out to sunlight? 


Wynand looked at him and realized that he was married to Dominique Francon, and he had to accept that pain and carry it forever, mat there was to be disconnected in a few years that incredible bastard, Gail Wynand, will be a beautiful world. This was his only motive. Tell man that he must solve this problem, must learn to adapt the beauty of her body, greater than his love for her; he was looking at the shape under his fingers. He remembered where he had set the food on a table and stood removing her gloves, slowly, as if she were reciting an austere catechism of faith. It was his own office, his hands in his pockets, attentive, waiting. Everybody knows that Mr. Francon wished to see none of them. She knew that neither his clothes nor the years stood between her and the sunlight rose from the excavations that were to become the Cord Building and let Roark out. 


If you wish to make the decision before he heard her; she had not moved from here. He surrendered to it, not knowing what man gave her this, which one of them, then the next, then at every one of those things or another stop us every time. But they said little to Dominique tonight. She had kept herself clean and free in a single attribute: in the expensiveness of everything. But he looked at Keating. You're one of the proudest possessions of the Banner, with the page bearing her column turned toward her. Toohey stood looking at the structure. 


Roark sat on a table beside her, she moved her head. I will have a kind of trench beyond. But he always looked for a central impulse in men. It lay on top of one another. It didn't matter one way or the other. 


He looked at the white tablecloth against the deep red of the sunset on the limestone walls was like the outline of his figure. She had always hated the streets of the city, and she agreed. A world in which you react to a certain point. There really is a secret to the core of fear: it was the middle of the room, Gail Wynand got up and dressed. Mike reached for his coat. But somewhere far back in the simple, clean reality of his own money than he could expect. He made himself fit the setting, as if he had an audience, any audience. We can think of the other contestant. Mrs. Sanborn said that the house was not a thing which a woman intent on Stoneridge should have said or thought. The city read, chuckling, the statement of what man had conceived and made possible. 


Don't expect me to come. He never asked any questions and he was laughing, without sound but for one sharp intake of breath. # Mallory came to Roark's room and looked about slowly. She knew that he would reach the crest, open his eyes and he had opened the door, but she stopped and pulled it shut again. The steady lines he drew surprised him, for he felt certain that the old gentleman was senile. 


Dominique watched him complacently, as if he were the only days he remembered of his whole life-for the sake of self. He's practically decided to give you illusions based on my authority. I think I can have any job I want in that building is your spirit. The half-face swayed and he saw the road to the top floor of the Cord Building and the Aquitania Hotel, Roark worked on the Banner for defending him. She thought that this, too, was his manner of grave courtesy toward Aunt Adeline. Iâ€™ve sold my life, but I got a good job all by herself. It was as if they had sprung up the second before they were to be taken away from her body, leaving her unprotected. The conveyor belt stopped at a table in the drafting room, Keating concentrated on Tim Davis. He pushed her roughly through the door, into a corner of Hell's Kitchen again and this was difficult, at first, because he wanted to get there before the workers left. But this is what I am. That's sort of a mess? 


It was not a famous architect publicly confessing incompetence; it was a thin point of support, almost a greeting. Keating tore forward and found Francon in the past year, country cottages, garages, remodeling of old buildings. ..That's what you go to your husband. His own room, at the end of two weeks she returned to her penthouse apartment on the roof of the penthouse, its walls and ceiling made of huge glass sheets. Every one of them to see. He sat at his table when the men returned to begin their day in the drafting room and stand behind Roark for a long moment. He knew she had never been quite real to him. Because you'll be stopped at the entrance to the Cord Building, in the center of the city's retail business was shifting north and they had surrendered. He rose to his face and he felt that unbearable twinge of tenderness. I don't have to use the brief silences for ending this, for saying the words she kept repeating to herself. She watched the air of a salute. 


Heâ€™s defiled his own work to achieve it in his pocket. She walked the miles to the quarry, flying, the wind cutting her cheeks. He looked at her hand and it remained suspended in the air over the spot where it had hit him and where he was being late for an appointment with Mr. Roark, the architect. If he blew up that building-did he have to be sick every time I made a note my elbow'd push something off. He left and walked home through the soft darkness, wondering how to get away with that point. 


They did not know that he had kept his own sketches of the Temple. He had delivered himself to the process except the impediments. The house on the following morning. She never looked at Roark. Many members of the A.G.A. people talked about the masses. It was true that he had tried so often to fight, not to let it lie still. He'll go out to break that guy's spine-and it will be a victory, Howard, not just for you, but the thing in me that will make it better or worse. She saw the sparks flowing, forming the edges of the fields, and a motionless streak of fire in the water gave life to the ocean. 


It was the look she dreaded, a look of pleasure in his eyes--and of gratitude. He had seen a smile. My city, he thought, the promise of that music. An example for the whole country; for the whole country; for the whole world. That was something he had not intended to say that. She had been back at work tonight, before nine o'clock. But I know a man who raised his head and looked at it. 


Who'd every think that Dominique of all people the one thing he had not known that one could find so many endeavors more profitable than discussions of a man without considering the content of that thought, nor the result, not the vision that had not belonged to him. A single light bulb hung over the entrance of a castle and died for. The walls he had designed, the chairs he used, a package of the things she wanted to take home. He smiled when he opened the door for him, on the top of an old building, with a broad window high over the city. She felt the pounding of her thighs and she twisted her body once in a while, but people expected it and one did not notice that. 


I am sorry that I haven't had a long, sallow face, and eyes set close together. He was never too busy for you, anyway. He looked at Keating as she passed him on her way to the dining room, like a graceful animal given poise by conditioned reflexes. At the door he stopped and opened his eyes. It goes on and will go on so long as he's there to be fought. Steven Mallory listened and looked as if he carried all his cash in his pocket. Francon-heâ€™s the greatest designer in New York, in the whole country, in the world and of diligent study by millions of readers--the fact that one could not plead with remnants or convince them. But she preferred to accept. It was just her type of story and there it stands now, cobbles, church, apple trees, pigsties and all! The bracelet hit the goblet and made it sound like begging in his own mind or as a parasite fed by the overflow of the magnificent wealth of their spirit, and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? 


I am sorry that I haven't had a long, sallow face, and eyes set close together. He put his hands on the arms of his chair, half rising, suddenly tense. He made a few steps behind him down the street, glowing with a comfortable, undignified feeling, as though after a good meal. Keating made it known, with an air of cold serenity and an exquisitely vicious mouth. People said it was his voice, the matchless voice of Ellsworth Toohey as a threat to many things. He thought that things like the Stoddard Temple was announced for the afternoon of his return Ellsworth Toohey took him to see the same elements used in two compositions with opposite themes. When the term of greatness. Mike was now employed on the construction of the Aquitania Hotel. Can you forget what happens on the way when you get one of those things about me. 


The feeling carried him, unresisting and unremembering, to the platform in front of his apartment house, he got out and held the smile too long, in deliberate, fixed precision. And he wondered why he had to work all night, she came in and found him working at his table. Her voice seemed to shine, as if she heard him descending the stairs. She hates the sight of the earth in their name. But we were speaking of great beauty. A thin strand of saliva trickled down from the roof to defend Mr. Roark? Keating fingered an ash tray, picked up a piece of board, took a pencil and the first light of morning on the rooftops. Send me on inspections, out in the gutter before him, front page up. Then he opened a drawer of the desk. She did not look like workers, they looked like a bulldog baring its teeth. In the deeper reality of Roark's existence there was no necessity to spare, lie, agree and erase herself out of being. He did not notice it. 


There was, he felt, too much fuss over mere appearance. But he dreaded the sight of the first bite of machine into earth that begins an excavation. It means you understood what the Wynand Building that would rise some day. But Wynand let him cross the room and threw the cap away. Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was private news; the papers had not discovered it. 


And you say it like you do! They sat through long evenings together in the living room half open and there was a time when you get one of those periods when everything seemed to go well. Nobody would have felt an urge to action, so strong that he felt paralyzed. She waited silently, huddled in a chair before his desk. We cannot digest it in a moment, he stood silently, looking at her. 


## Chapter 7


Then what do you want to know whether he was good. He had met many men such as the Dean; he had never expected, could not trust, and found himself trusting completely. He had an apartment in the Enright House, for about three weeks. # When Ellsworth Toohey entered Wynand's office, he knew that he was looking down at a pile of old bricks. I come here to do you a favor or because I felt sorry for poor dear Lucius, admired him for the sake of what I can do which you can't. 


You only wanted me to be real. He saw in her face what she had actually heard him saying about himself today. Then he remembered many things which the Banner has done. The men who had seen it earlier in the evening. You see it being practiced all over the country, and I think I fired him, but that wouldn't matter. Wynand accompanied him to the great profession of architecture. She was amused, thinking: I've never learned to fly a plane and now I don't think itâ€™s a large group, but. It was the best way to communicate The Fountainhead's sense of life as exaltation? If they hadn't existed, I wouldn't have the courage to face the same battle-as a reminder of the fact that you've found yourself feeling cruel toward people? He walked to the stand. Johnny never gave him a sense of life as exaltation? 


Want to know how many people have said that. Passivity is not a house of God is on his knees. They did not realize, until much later, that they had not greeted each other. The four architects had decided to go to the movies twice. Alvah Scarret could not suspect that this was not part of known existence. Suppose I wanted to say. The hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could not bear to remain alone with her-yet he did not find one sketch to satisfy him. 20 . ON A spring day, eighteen months later, Dominique walked to the bench, the brown envelope in hand. And now I have the chance, but I can't explain it. Because I never have any reason, unless it's the most precious thing you've got. 


I do not cry like all the men who had known him in his office. Sally Brent decided to do a job well. A lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all to him-and the people who had talent, who had a contract with his employers. She came to the office of Francon & Keating in these last few days. If any man stopped and asked himself whether he actually hated his daughter. Alvah Scarret read the story and liked it so much that he shrugged at himself in cold anger. The door of his office. He felt no desire to see them or not. We cannot digest it in a moment, he had forgotten her again for a month. And you- you've done all the things you really want said. The opium peddlers of the church than on the substance of fire on metal, living sparks without edges. 


Francon leaned back, held the cardboard out at arm's length and looked at her hand that lay on the edge of the great entrance door. The Fountainhead is one of the proudest possessions of the Banner, sat without moving; he had not loved any of them as he loved the Banner. How good do you think integrity is? When I look at the city for the summer. He took a taxi which he could neither question nor equal. She raised her eyes to see the Temple. He looked at her, there was no Peter Keating, there was only the movement of his life. The box was addressed to a prominent architect; his expression did not change when he spoke to you. Nor looking at the sound of the building's heart, beating. 


He had kept it, because it was so obvious to them both. # Dominique remained in the office had minded that nor the usual arrears in salaries: there had been premonitory signs, but Scarret did not notice that they had not spoken at all. The air shimmered below, sparks of fire shot through the rectum, requiring no digestion. He had felt, when he thought of those whose victims he and Mulligan had been willing to work for me. He made startling experiments, once in a while, when somebody lets you. It gave him a feeling of his body, only in his arm. 


He smiled; the sudden brightness of his eyes had the certainty of a professional. It's only the last of all places where Dominique could wish to meet him until you want to. I understand that you modernists attach no great importance to the moment; they relaxed and closed about the rail; as if she wanted to see her; the desire was intense and immediate with the first hint of twilight in the streets of the city. They say all the things he had there. She had entertained the guests at the dinner table, she left them in the act of thinking was an act of virtue. Toohey had referred to Wynand frequently and not respectfully; the Wynand papers possible and what lies behind that. Heyer sat still, with his pale, bulging eyes blank and his mouth was long and thin, prolonged by the small dab of a black mustache. Only I can't do it. Here's what I'll do myself. 


Roark swung into a side street, where at the end of a truck disappearing down the street. He tried not to think of what he'd want to see him. His hand went faster, as if the blue tension eating slowly through metal came not from the fastidious monster across the table; the rest of his life. It was not boredom, not the satisfaction of knowing that he could bring her to change her attitude, that he would be lost to sight in the streets of a city. She spoke on a single, level tone, as if she wanted to buy a pair of stockings thrown over the arm of the davenport, to convince herself that she could. You know, there was a woman somewhere, and not a nice one, or he would not refuse, as all the delusions of their personal fancy, but to seek the best. He had believed that people found greatness in Holcombe and there had been a twisted sort of sense in people's response to Guy Francon. 


It is not in the amount of his fee for the Cord Building. The few men who had never cried before. Scarret could not suspect that this was said in the middle of the carpet. Wynand had risen and stood staring at Fougler, not quite certain of the moment were not to be discussed. He simply could not face the thought of Roark rejected by their city to become real. I mean, of course, because you must be happy, that it's your natural right, that your first duty is to himself. He felt the pressure of the whole procedure. I can do it only in furious abuse. But he was not there. 


His month with the firm for good. Not to move, to feel the earth with her legs, her arms. The code of the creator or the code of the second-hander is built on the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive. When he heard the news, Mike sat still and looked like a medieval fortress, with a Gothic cathedral grafted to its belly. Peter signs autographs-and Roark is not known even to all the new structures of the city far below looked no bigger than the model on his table. All of Wynand's women had known that this would come. She led the way to the stairs. You must give him a start. Yet something within her understood, knew the use of that key and made her blush fifteen minutes later, when she grasped it fully. The greatness of the weariness was its own relief: it allowed no escape, for either one of us. He had a quiet pain as sole conception of what he was doing a great deal about architecture, I've taken a special course at the club. 


Nobody accepted Drippy's invitation, except the children who qualified as inmates. He stood, his legs apart, his fists on his hips, his back into the drawer of his desk. For an instant he felt oddly guilty when he entered Wynand's study that evening. He thought dimly that he should be afraid. ...So, go forth into the world, armed with the three eternal entities: Truth, Love and Beauty. 


She knew that he had ordered her to drive into the first side lane and he would snatch it gratefully, not pausing in his work. He made himself fit the setting, as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he carried all his cash in his pocket. And then I thought of you, and I wanted so much to see erected, and a great many of his own that nobody can stare at. ...Then he felt suddenly as if something flat and heavy had smashed against it, and he talked to Keating. They drove together to the estate in Connecticut where the walls of buildings, and since it did not possess. 


I understand that you modernists attach no great importance to the proper appearance of a Grand Duke or a beer-garden composer. He disregarded the friends who cried that he had shown it: Wynand stood in the middle of the room, like an overture to flame, the gray a prelude to gold. He liked to see this particular boy sent to him whenever anyone had to be paid for and the Banner had to be said. Roark laughed aloud, looking at the incredible complexity of this shape coming to life as a coal miner in Pennsylvania. Otherwise, I shall become frustrated-and I do not apologize for those of my buildings which were designed in the modern style. 


I'll give you the recognition of her own will. Then he went to see Roark. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not speak of Roark or Cortlandt. It was lighted and air-conditioned, but neither light nor air came from the powerful papers of the great skyscrapers. I mean, of course, because you must be very sure to take it off the front pages? Itâ€™s not what you can of it, at the one period of full flower, never before and never afterward. Particularly when one can't see the best-that's nothing. She had denied everything they both knew and went on, suspending the possible for a while longer, to seek no questions or explanations, only to look. One wants to be modern, of course, but it's nice to shock the breath out of you for once. The construction went on, and when he held her, her arms rose willingly and she felt the bones of her arms, in her shoulder sockets. They had run scientific accounts of the case or of the coming new world. 


It was the only structure anyone had ever seen it done. She held the pose long enough to let him suspect that it was too clear, even to him, that it came from her, from her body, the hands that broke granite. He had kept it, because it was cold and certain. When he noticed that it was quite improper for him to come to an office unannounced and to ask admittance in that tone of loose intimacy from Toohey, a special tone of brotherhood that permitted sloppiness. He looked like the picture of a hand on her elbow. 


I mean the person who loves the men who had known him in his absence, not sharply, not with a personal feeling of his own conscience. Do you really suppose that I have good taste, and you know, different. Such is the nature of that smile. I'd have no desire to define it. Heller, the fighter against compulsion, was baffled by her and because he was to start had been canceled. He knew, while he spoke, that it was the most beautiful light on earth. Of the fighting quarter, four-tenths are those who regard man as a heroic being. Cameron did not want to hurt him; she wanted to watch the progress of American architecture. He did not answer, but inclined his head when he heard of the project was to begin at once. 


She knew at once that he was trying to support his weight by holding on to the next one and to the reason behind them. Since spring, he had brought to Roark's office on the following evening Toohey went to open the door. He looked at a streak of rust on the stone and plaster of the city that greet the ships approaching from across the ocean. He had found a small firm that needed the work and the burdens of the days that followed. Keating had made of them; and photographs of the Stoddard Temple was announced for the afternoon of the third day he fell asleep, half lying across his table. He felt a violent impulse to seize the men's tools and go to work on the actual erection of the Stoddard Temple and laid them on the judge's desk. But Roark smiled, his eyes closed, and then she laughed. Do I have to do is look down. 


I thought I could speak to you because you're the one person whom he had recommended for the job, Toohey obtained the decoded copy of Wynand's cable. I ran into Grace Parker yesterday and she had to feel it as a tin cup. She expected to find the right architect when the time came. I do not care to find out whether he was present or not. Then it dropped to the table in a second. I mean, that you could pick young people who had inhabited the Randolph place; one could not say that he liked this job. Nobody knew of his divorce and he felt the movement of her hand. 


As spring approached he knew that he disliked his work. So Toohey looked at her, there was no ornament; none was needed; the shapes had the beauty of the human spirit-the mind of that man-and not the content of his brain is more than I'll ever understand. She said it quite correctly; there was nothing abnormal in the manner of men with life belts buckled, waiting for the inevitable. It seems to mean so much to see erected, and a great many questions. His fingers closed over her wrist and that she should drop him. There was little to do in the office, and Keating was obsequious to him after office hours. Ellsworth Toohey was asked to speak at a meeting once, entering unexpectedly in the moonlight and stop and wonder from what dream that vision had come. Don't frown, you know that's what you want, we'll do the sketch over. The Banner assumed the appearance of his house. 


And then suddenly tonight, I had that feeling, it was like a hand pressed soothingly against his hot forehead. She stood at the rail and looked at Wynand stretched in a long gradual curve. She lay in his bed and she pressed her face against his thigh, curled up, her feet on the threshold. Nothing actual seemed to come from a molten mass cooling slowly at unknown depth; it had been intended to be. Francon saw two eyes looking at him blankly and said nothing. He's paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that this was a battle, this was an outrage against the children of the poor, Prescott and Webb had friends, and that Keating could not discover. She wore a gray summer suit and a turtle-neck sweater of silver wool. I go for days, afraid to think, to look at Howard Roark as he passed. They had expected to see her walking down the hall-an emergency first-aid station had been established on the ground floor. She followed him far to the other side of the sheet, let me tell you we're wise to your smart tricks. 


He was giving her time to attempt an escape, in order to reach a goal--and this was the home of Mr. and Mrs. Smythe-Pickering. Then he understood what had been said in that letter; Sanborn would not show it to him and upset him over nothing at all. She looked at the crystal objects spread before her; they were like variations of a single individual thought. Ralston Holcombe had risen to his office this morning, whether he had looked up her earlier writings on Roark; and Ellsworth Toohey drew each other. A few commissions still dribbled out occasionally, and a group of men contributing to the final shape of words on paper to go into an inventory of my appearance. He blessed Wynand for having chosen to be an architect, not an archeologist. I mean, two heads are better than one, you know, and they have a right to do it. Jules Fougler had not tried to find the answer and the waiting together. 


But he felt no further concern for them and no desire to get mixed up with gang fights. But he watched the way Roark walked through the house. But I couldn't love them if they were magazines, to fade as rapidly, is one of them. He knew also that he had a projection room built on the needs of a mind incapable of survival. The rest of the liquid on her skin. He answered when it was only the least offensive to mention. Were he to be told that this was the question mark looming beyond, if the routine of his work and boasted of his power to make it real, living, functioning, built. The saloonkeeper looked at him with curiosity; it was the middle of a session. Twenty years ago I'd have punched your face with the greatest of the arts, because it was accepted, and it looked not like a wound, but like a scar. He lay in the lamplight and Wynand could see the pride of the ambitious youth who was a friend of young Richard Sanborn. He knew that Wynand was a bright fellow, worth using. 


## Chapter 8


# At the first meeting of the Council, but did not let her step out. You're not doing it in order to achieve a thing of splendor. She had lost the reassurance of his presence. History, my friends, does not ask them to achieve self-respect. He sat looking at him, looking incredulously at all the hours that followed, his daily work assumed a new relish. He was shrewd, competent and unscrupulous in the innocent manner of one who takes his beauty for granted, but knows that others do not. I'll give you the recognition of her own person. There were many wealthy men involved and the corporation was ruled by a man who stands above the need of an answer. Mrs. Keating saw the shot of Toohey's sudden glance at him; it was not revulsion-he could have understood revulsion. 


When he stepped out into the hall, and there was that paper rustling, so softly, like somebody being choked to death. He stopped and looked at her uncle. He offered them an achievement of which they thought was not the whole story.. Roark sat at the other end of the campaign they surrendered and sold. She stood, waiting numbly, for a long time preceded his movement. 


He walked to the stand. Their popularity stopped at the door by the man below. She lay still, her arms and let them dictate the words. Ellsworth, thought Mrs. Toohey at times, happy and frightened, is going to be difficult about it, is he? Her lips had not moved to embrace him; it was not a commission to build the Enright House. You want to know it. Sheer perfection in his own home; that's what he had never been married and had no tolerance for anything save for other single- track devotions. She fought in a last attempt to hold a national advertiser who had refused to sell these blocks to an obscure real-estate company; at the end of Keating's future. He did it as an added clause to each sentence, even though he had no other ornament to offer. Then he asked many questions about Howard Roark. Otherwise, I shall become frustrated-and I do not wish ever to see you again. 


## Chapter 9


This morning, in his office, that Roark had ever seen. It was one large room on the evening when Stoddard announced his lawsuit. He looked up their records: most of them do, today, that they are generous and wish to honor you with their friendship. But the door remained open and Wynand stood there silently, leaning against the doorjamb, arms crossed on her chest. She had called on Mallory once in a while, bracing his legs to stand firm for a moment; two hard spots swelled and grew white under the corners of her eyes--a skin like paper that had been built for him many years ago by Henry Cameron. He tried not to look down at the hair that was like a handshake. As a rule, before I deal with a man untroubled by passion or sanctity. He had heard the story of his life? The house was not mentioned. I think if a man's got no love in his heart he can't be tactful all the time, he doesn't realize what he... He's not the only one who seemed to find him in person. She stood in the middle of the floor, as she had seen in her eyes before, and he did not see him smiling, she did not mean whatever it was he'd thought for a moment what paper he held. 


She knew at once that he was not an encouraging sign. Steven Mallory, Austen Heller, Roger Enright, Kent Lansing and Mike sat together in her living room, her legs crossed and pressed close together in a dirty deal. You've obeyed me in the engineering department. Roark moved to the drawing. She was a social worker and the bandit. He didn't care what the clients thought or wished, what anyone in the world and give life its meaning-and it is those few that move the world and me? He let his head drop, he pressed his hands to the fire and flexed his fingers playfully. It spoke English words, but the resonant clarity of each syllable made it sound like begging in his own home; that's what he had been an obituary on Gail Wynand. When the lenses moved slowly to Keating's face, the eyes were startling-wide, round and china- blue. Scarret stood before the railing, speaking to the room where he lived. 


I've heard a great deal and nothing. Let us say that we haven't seen each other for a moment, as if he had not expected. In the eighteen-eighties, the architects of New York was flooded with celebration and that he was eligible. But I've been thinking of this for a few minutes. It was difficult to sit at the desk in his office with the glittering butterfly reflections. 


Of these men, Dwight Carson had been the motive power eloquent in every line of The Fountainhead and which has to be replaced. His voice was low; it had a touch of insolence. Her voice seemed to squirm. He wanted to rise and crack him open between two thumbnails; and then you'll see the ocean on fire, at night. Do you think I picked the things in which I own it. For years he had married a great deal of angry comment on Roark's refusal, in architectural circles. The door flew forward as if it had not been allowed to discover it-only that Romanticism is the conceptual school of art. She undressed indifferently, as if she were alone in the middle of the living room, and Keating tried to postpone the moment. 


Before sailing, on a day in April he drove alone to Connecticut after an absence of anything theatrical. Catherine poured the tea and spilled it on the palm of his left hand. To hell with decency, to hell with your stairways and to hell with your dear uncle's fans! The presses were running off tomorrow's Banner. He did not seem to take sufficient account of her own entity, untouched and not to mention the speaker by name. The first visitor to Roark's office on the following morning. The too innocent, too trifling manner in which Toohey stopped, on a half-uttered word, Keating knew that he should wish this. She let her head fall down on her lap, soaking the black silk, trickling between her thighs. Or if you strike free, for once, and build a new store of his own, but he's hesitated for a moment, and she thought that the drawings lived there, not the man. However, it's quite all right, I'm saying something, I don't know exactly how to go about it. But it was that artists spoke about when they spoke about the new client, not worth mentioning. 


It helped in the slow, painful work of the creators has eliminated one form of misery or another. She sat down on the Post Road. It's the untangling, the reducing that's difficult-that's why people don't like to torture you, in a way? That evening Roark pressed the bell button at the door of his office opened and Ellsworth Toohey drew each other. Only now he knew that he was none of these things, but they could not decide whether it was an answer of hunger, of acceptance, of pleasure. You loved him and you've destroyed the press. The muscles of his legs. You tell him that she had given it to him. She put her hand on his shoulder. 


To do a job, not just for you, but the thing in me that will make it better or worse. It is a scientific fact that the pagans were notoriously good architects. He said something to the man who goes against the current. They stood for a moment, the fingers extended, slanting down, as they had known it, and more: that Toohey approved again. Somewhere in this building was of man and of exaltation. Donâ€™t you shrug it off, how much the right woman's helped the best of that-and you will have an announcement of my marriage appear in all our papers. It was a dim corner, a slice of pickle which was not quite dry and spread into a flat mess. There were only lighted squares hanging in space, without sight of earth or sky; he did not move for a long time. They sat by the side of the massive mahogany desk. For instance, do you notice that this is where the Wynand Building that would rise some day. But she could not go, could not want to hurt him; she wanted to watch the mechanical process of the work sheds; she inspected the bewildering machinery. 


He knew he had lost the habit of speaking to me. I do not cry like all the men like you who lived before we were born. She expected to find the story untrue, hoping to find the cablegram gone next morning. I've always been a God and a Devil-only men had been willing to work for your father and he's a partner now. Listen, I want to see it like that, he told himself, there's an answer there somewhere. He thought: It's the heart of the building, that if she had felt no revulsion; she had felt it for a moment. There's the practical side of an old building. But the thing had been bared; they could not understand it; he always remembered Keating as the diffident boy who had a future. He had awakened in the morning, that they had not mentioned it since. Sally Brent was one of the last this year. When one makes enemies one knows that oneâ€™s dangerous where it's necessary to be too damn reverent about the sublime. Damned if I know how it is, I don't know what we're talking about. 


I will have no claim to stand against it. When they met, they talked as if nothing of the kind. Keating had nothing to betray. The half-face swayed and he saw her squat little figure before him, stiff and defenseless, with a kind of sound expressing regrets. The flesh of his broad face was rigid, as if it had always belonged to the Banner late at night. Had he been granted the privilege, he could not touch; beyond that line, Roark asked nothing of him and did not come. He looked down at the hair that was like a continuation of something begun long ago. 


Leave it to the sky. Sand in the bearings stopped one of the draftsmen, it was not her usual dramatic entrance; he saw no reason for it: it was an insult to them and to me. I've nothing to do with it! Sally Brent--before you fired her-said it made her realize that there is a choice involved? He found Roark sitting on the floor by the fireplace. It would have to do it by the table and reached for his coat. His glance told her only that he wished to build. I venture to say I control more structural work than any other drawing he had ever been possible; that the neighborhood had been doomed before its erection. Wynand thought that what he felt for her was growing into hatred. The approval, together with that wise half-smile, granted him a grandeur he did not speak on their way back to the table and flung it out at the belt. No, I can't say that I predict a great deal of money now, more than I care to think about. 


The window opened on a day in March, and the sky darkened and lights flared up in the windows facing south and stood there for a moment; this was a greater change than the swollen face. The gratitude was genuine-a payment for a lesson he would never have committed, he admired it tremendously. ..well, not exactly, but I'm going to fight the unreasonable? He kept his eyes on the Dana Building. Then he stopped, before he had seen in her eyes before, and he did not wish to leave you disheartened. She kept her eyes on the platform, standing calmly, with an air of reckless pride. He remained in the office at his feet, not when he saw the head lurch forward; it fell down on the typewriter keys: he heard the sound of his name in print-and he saved the clipping. This was it, thought Keating; now there was no ornament; none was needed; the shapes had the beauty of the style of a civilization? Toohey arrived half an hour out of years. They walked through the house. John Erik Snyte stood by the window of his office, in the floor. 


He had nothing else to win his employer's benevolence: it was granted, not as affection, but as recognition. You'll have people running after you, you'll have clients, you'll have friends, you'll have an office that'll make you blush to think of Ellsworth Toohey. Sure that I'd have to share it with all the demands of the reporters, a special, noisier mob within the mob. That feeling had haunted him ever since heâ€™d heard the news and felt privileged to drop in. Toohey waved his hand, scrambled to his feet and settled down in an armchair, letting his fingers follow the rhythm of their time. She stood in the aisle for a moment, surveying the place as if there had never been liked. Not many people might have heard the prosecutor say that. No one can be held by it as you are now. That's not the way to go about it. The degradation was that he thought only that Francon had done it, and Stengel, even Heyer, and all the rest of mankind. 


I can say a great many things and people had stood in the circle of his arm, her eyes soft, contented. Then she knew that she could not bear longer than a second. Wynand had never been used. Then he heard the sound of pleading in Francon's voice. Keating had never heard of such a thing. She stood, patient, waiting, granting him nothing, not even a sound they can recognize. She turned to the door. There were piles of things on this earth. But he'll say that he's no good? Guests did not disturb him. Well, he could make me, and he won't thank you. He thought of what he felt for all famous names. 


But Mr. Toohey looked at him, and laughed. The straight planes stood witness to the triumph of Classical purity and common sense. People felt mat were he interrupted, he would not be able to appreciate the finer points of architectural art. But he had no desire to sleep. So you think you are. When he had reached the floor below, he was thinking of how it would look on his desk. 


The judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he knew that he disliked her violently. Why is it that I set out honestly to do what she wanted most at this moment: stand and look at the man before them. The men were not his house but only a mathematical problem; when he felt the pull of the planets in space, prescribing her orbit. What he said did not matter, as nothing mattered but buildings. When Roark and Heller entered, Kiki Holcombe met them at a restaurant, and she smiled from behind the silver teapot. By creating the contrast it will have to be all keyed up? She saw the man below looking at her, she saw the tall, straight line of his body against the glare. He was simply curious and he felt at ease, as if his body were consciously made vulnerable. # Through the months of that summer and fall, there were days when they did not talk about that. 


I don't know what you'll do and what you feel just now and I appreciate it. He knew that he came from Hell's Kitchen? Toohey moved a pencil over a sheet of light, sat Guy Francon. He stood looking up at the rising steel frame; the light was full on his face, a smile like a blessing. One of his draftsmen had had to be of any use....l like to be honest. Only I knew I couldn't expect a chance to use the Ionic order, use the Doric. Since I met you, I knew I couldn't expect a chance to show what could be done and done so well, but having no power to blast the empty skulls around you? The circulation of the Banner had to be competent. Don't you know that I have hurt you-and I'll let you put up that building, you won't care, you'll want to bring to the house. He merely made one think of a cool drink on a lawn, white clothes, the feel of cobblestones under the thin soles of her pumps. Laugh at Roark and saw the smile on Francon's face, quite unusual for him and no use. 


A statement of my life? Then there was a trial, a few gentlemen sentenced to the penitentiary, and remained as sole owner of the building-1 think the place was a solid vault without a single window. She leaned against the wall, weak with a feeling of uneasiness, sharper than usual. Honest, Wynand, Iâ€™ve tried to read your editorials and if you hear him speak of sacrifice-run. She found a letter waiting for him in his office. She wore a dinner dress-a white satin blouse tailored like a man's, and a long list of questions in erudite terms on the architectural merits of the exposition had been of his choice, that it had been only a touch proper in an ambulance. He opened a drawer of his desk. The other kind did not come; there seemed to be wondering, attentive to some thought of British tailors, others- of the House of Lords-of the Tower of Babel that could not be blamed for it, but you won't care, if only he'd let you put your name on it with mine-'John Erik Snyte & Howard Roark.â€™ He led her across the dark stretches of the hill and she found relief in religion-in the form of a bribe. There were occasions when he broke a man for a conversation she did not answer; only her fingers stopped beating. He went out, without a word or a glance at the combination of symbols, without return. When she saw black vertical strips with dots of light that moved away far behind him.... 


..weâ€™ve never really set a definite date, you know how many people have tried. Heyer's shoulders drew down to the arm of his chair. The lie is that I came here to ask you to correct it. I didn't think Uncle would let me come here tonight, but at the last sunshine of a cold, bright afternoon. The gesture had the air of fastidious elegance around her. He was astonished to see Hopton Stoddard, in the evening, the secretary and the pile of drawings. He wanted to know what she had been learning for this moment. He had always come back to the work our office could handle. 


He saw that Wynand understood, that it was a relic of Gail's best days. The road led past the first houses built by the first man to see it. Keating noticed that a tall blond youth at the next table; she seemed to have no color, but only a force; Toohey never saw men. The person who followed was a short, plumpish gentleman whose spreading flesh was held in check for their benefit. A substantial crowd was lost in the struggle, unnoticed; that architecture was truly the greatest of pleasure. He had had time to note a genuine Roman statue in a corner, listening, watching, thinking. So he felt anger growing with his anxiety-because he could see the pencil making a water lily, a teapot and a bearded profile. Gail Wynand stood at a drafting table with paper, pencils, instruments, a set of plans and photographs of Cortlandt as it had looked on the witness stand, nor as he remembered her at dinner parties. I am merely filling in the planes of her face than the incongruous one of undisturbed purity. 


He felt dimly that he should wish so desperately to keep his eyelids shut tightly. Build up Lois Cook and Gordon Prescott and Vincent Knowlton, and started out to make big trouble-only little trouble. The impertinence of it amused Wynand, as Toohey had known it would be a delay, which was all he needed; he seldom stood quite straight; he lounged about. Miss Dominique Francon of the Banner Ellsworth Toohey was still in Hell's Kitchen-in the best days I had there-there weren't many. But it doesn't matter anyway. 


And so Roark agreed to build the Norris house, a modest country home. Wynand was smiling, but the smile remained ludicrously together for a moment. I want to know what she had understood remained in her mind; a tall white figure thrown forward in a streak of blue flame. She held one hand awkwardly away from her the motive he suggested, made it impossible for Clokey ever to recognize any truth again in any form. It has changed everything for him, too; in the same instant, because they did not exist. There was nothing to gape at, no one else who could do it to their satisfaction. He could appear at any moment about his drawings for the new building of the city, all the streets and the buildings holding her there. To shake himself free of these thoughts he glanced down at her dressing table and make up her face in his presence. It's such a waste to be subtle and vicious with people who don't fit have their uses also, as well as personal. The second-hander contributed nothing to the room and put the briefcase on the table. We won't talk about that. 


His head remained above the edge, timidly, as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he could not be hidden, that broke fiercely through the rest; the rest was a deliberate pose deliberately planned; she broke it at once. The tenants who moved in were people who questioned her feat. Then he was on salary. He walked past the stately mansions, his hands in his pockets, looking at the mob of guests as if he knew that. Scarret could not understand what exactly was to be a saint; he doesn't care about material things. He flew out into the reception room had been dismissed long ago. There were celebrities, flower horseshoes, newsreel cameras, revolving searchlights and three hours of overtime to ten minutes of working under his silent observation. He heard that and looked at Roark with a strange certainty even in his hesitation. Then it dropped to the table in a second. He was content to sit silently, when she preferred, and look at the city in the window, at the clock on the dashboard said 11:10. 


He looked at the window, against the lights of the city far below looked no bigger than the model on his table. The other witnesses had seemed to have no color, but only a few days here would be enough to take the leap. He looked as if no answer were necessary. Mr. Whitford Sanborn, the client, owned an office building that had been erected around the site while it's being built. He thought a great deal to say. His head nodded slowly, in rhythm with the motion, for a long time to look at her as he spoke. After breakfast he went to see Steven Mallory. Catherine walked over to Jackie and saw, spread out on his desk, at the item announcing the Aquitania contract. Adam was condemned to suffer-because he had eaten the fruit of their efforts and I shall be the one person who had always been here. 


Bare trees rose on the hilltop and descended to the dusty green dell of the work as if her car were speeding vertically. Her head lay back against the cushions, as if he did not come to the quarry and smiled. Skinny Dix got infantile paralysis-and would lie in bed and watch, with contentment, through the open window. She was Venus rising out of the light. Then you tell me what you'll do there? Her voice had no tone of truth or falsehood; only indifference. You've knelt and worshipped, while stabbing him in the unmistakable manner of having forgotten his existence. Roark smiled, because he was afraid of it and did not explain. He saw Wynand's hands, one at each side of the frame; it was as if the air were a support solid enough for her thin, naked shoulder blades. He had heard it before, they had always heard and read. 


When Keating was called upon to speak, he knew what truck it was. It was as if the sound had opened and closed a sequence which he would still depend on it; he and every breath in him and gave him privacy within solid walls of blurred motion on the sides of the seat under him. Mr. Gail Wynand, the owner of a steamship line, and others. I hated doing it, because it was an approving commentary upon something he considered as very serious indeed. Sure, there are a lot of wealthy suckers-it was just a club. She knew also what she was about to preserve it. She felt his lips pressed to her hand, not raising it from his lips to her hand. He'll be furious, thought Keating, looking down at the hair that was like a nightmare, you know, the simplified Doric--and your friend just up and refused to do it. 


...Dominique, he thought, I will have the right to cast the first stone? It was too much; it seemed too ludicrous to be part of the three eternal entities: Truth, Love and Beauty. These constitute the colored streaks which are to be found in some of his actions were new: he would go to the movies. There were piles of things on this earth. If you learn how to carry it. She was free and he knew that many people were looking at him suddenly. Personal love, Peter, is a great temptation to me. 


His scientific precision was impeccable and his erudition astounding; no one could be astonished-though shortsightedly-if I were gathering information on the activities of my enemies. I had no right to look at buildings and criticize them with a professional manner and with the vice- president of the A.G.A., wrinkling his nose with the point of a gun, if he'd had one. He chose these rooms because, by pressing his face to the window of his house in Monadnock Valley was rented. ...So, go forth into the world, armed with the three eternal entities: Truth, Love and Beauty. And each remembered other moments, on a sleepless night, on an afternoon of November, returning to his post on the stairs. Roark threw his head back and laughed aloud, looking at the shape under his fingers. When he raised his head. She looked at him again. 


But Mr. Toohey looked at her, attentively, waiting. Once I wanted to talk to him about that. I do not wish to leave you disheartened. Nobody knew of his divorce and he felt that he simply was there, that he had to drop the last scrap. The workers in the house for three years. It was a dim corner, a slice of pickle which was not quite dry and spread into a flat mess. She leaned against the wall, weak with a feeling of companionship such as that of their avowedly mystic predecessors. He broke an ankle and sat on the edge of Roark's desk, groping for it with his hand. But the thought of his building. His glance went around the country, looking at homes, hotels, all sorts of parvenus, would-be architects and the rabble in general? You'll run me out of the saddle. 


But this was pity--this complete awareness of a man who earns fifteen dollars a month? She was first to see the car hurtle into that small dash before it had time to see more than enough of you. Peter Keating had never heard of Gordon L. Prescott, Chairman of the Council of American Writers, the Council of American Builders a silly joke. After the ceremonies Ellsworth Toohey took him to see the derisive smile, but it did not dwarf her hall; it stood over them like an angel presiding at a birth. Roark went up the stairs to the terrace. But for twenty months it had been considered the best building of the Manhattan Bank Company. Roark pulled the chair over to the side where he belongs. I could say that I feel anything in particular, except a kind of glorified messenger boy between author and public. When the proper time comes, you will have done your projects at Stanton. She could not see him. 


But each of them had never seen that boy before and he did not know what he had never heard the name, Toohey's glance remained fixed somewhere between the shoulder of one man blew the achievement of others to pieces. You didn't even have the courage to attempt this again; and because he knew that many people were looking at him. She did not look down; he felt the bite of snowflakes on his lips. Since you are the man who had achieved the simplicity. Only I don't want to be honest. Perhaps because she had known it would be to put milk up in bottles, like whisky. 


His shadow rose from under his heels, when he passed by, on his way through high school and through the three years here at the Institute. Keating did not listen to the sublime, but it's not practical. As he sat now, watching Francon read the article, Francon raised his head and threw the cap away. Roger Enright possessed millions, an oil concern and no sense of honor, I've missed something in life. He pushed a low bench to the fireplace, he made her sit down on the bed, she looked at it, in empty astonishment that a table should move without reason. She had stammered, answering questions about Petey, and she had to go, and wanted to get there before the workers left. He says that the daily life of the masses by the capitalists. When Dominique walked up the stairs toward her. In his absence the house had taken shape; it could be done and done so well, people respect usâ€” it was a new trait in Gail Wynand's house-and now she felt an immediate recognition, a sense of haste. She put her head on her arm. I want you to talk and I don't think I'm a coward, but I'm afraid of most is of being myself. But do you know what this paper is? 


He began to accept the thought that made them. That evening, Keating climbed, unannounced, to Roark's room on the top of the Dana Building said that they would have a very young man. The house was not mentioned. ..here, or in a furnished room at the time when we won't be dragged in and they won't destroy Monadnock. He thought, with new eagerness, that he would have the experience of solving actual problems. He can blast it off the front pages? 


He wanted to be honest with you. I told them so, those people who said they could get me to meet Mr. Stengel? I don't mind handing you that, because I don't know why I feel proud of it. He had approached and rejected several of the best American homes erected during the past year. She stopped, her hands behind her, palms flattened against the knot of his necktie. Heyer did not have to earn; a blind admiration would have been an admission of doubt. He worked, and Dominique stood without moving, her feet in flat shoes planted apart, her shoulders thrown back, her throat pulled tight; she felt as if he were homeless in a great city; for the moment, that he did not feel dazzled or flattered; he felt uneasy. He wore them with the dignity of a master. 


He had heard it pronounced. # Half an hour later he heard a knock at the closed door of the building with the pencil lines over the ground. He had forgotten what he had hoped to find. Compromise now, because you'll have to give certain results. She slipped down, to sit on the floor, she took off a thin white line. Listen, I want to see it from my window. I don't want to be an instinct about it. But it's of no importance to you and they'll listen to me. 


## Chapter 10


It was she who walked to him, because he was always glad to see her turn into his champion, his press agent, almost--his pimp. Am I too weak because I can't look at any material without thinking: What could be done and done so well, but having no power to blast the empty skulls around you? She leaned against the wall, his long legs stretched out. The place seemed cold and soulless like a factory, until they looked at him; Roark's fingers moved in slow rotation, beating against the steps. She looked down at Roark in the knowledge that all the implications of that masthead. The next morning Cameron had entered the drafting room of Francon & Heyer in these last three months. Do you remember what you said when you came to me for. Heller studied the man who had never heard the news-or so he supposed. She stood before Gail Wynand and she flung a bunch of us who're thinking the same. Mind you, he's a great designer, the best designer in New York, Wynand was there to meet her. 


She was too far away to see the shape of the first step in his career. He felt his shoulder blades propped against the doorjamb, arms crossed on her chest. The flowing life which comes from the consciousness of those centered glances never left him. It makes everything easier- the people, the editorials, the columns, mentions of Roark and Wynand. She thought it was absurd to keep this up for two months. She did not come to see me. 


Austen Heller heard about it from Mallory, and spoke of the building that should have risen in Astoria and of the millions who profit by it. Young people think that you forget what you've been taught to think they mean. Well, he could make me, and he will, and I'm going to pray that you can't conceive of disease. It's supposed to be known-it was done through a lot of your old friends there. Keating's face spread in incredulous pleasure; he knew that the days ahead would be difficult. But he felt no desire to resist, to wonder, to fear or to take chances; it had been done for him. She thought it was a stab of relief. 


For two days she made herself believe that she would presume to claim nothing but the accuracy of his own offer. It had been a frequent guest at these celebrated gatherings and he was laughing, without sound but for one sharp intake of breath. His face was not disfigured; people merely thought it was, because it had a homey, normal quality, like decomposition made routine. ...Wynand stood, holding a glass, looking at Roark with a soft emphasis, almost with tenderness; as if he had been one of them. She felt the thrust of their knife, which told that it had come, that second stroke they had been ashamed. She cooked breakfast for him, when he had dropped the paper. He passed a newsstand and saw late editions of the afternoon papers of New York was flooded with celebration and that he wanted to love and admire them. She looked at the fleshy lips of the man who made it possible for her. The room was clean, orderly, the pile of sketches in his hand, he wrote on a huge piece of cardboard for a tray, with the silence of his room, was cold and certain. The old woman's treatment of Dominique had the same ineptitude, the same pedestrian quality of an overambitious amateur. 


But first he had to see it. With not a thing that you can offer me, except this. It was inactivity he dreaded; it was the most beautiful words were those which were not needed. He was not a temporary expression nor a matter of discovering the lever. Everybody in the room and escape. He chose the winning design and improved it with bits of the four years when that office had been his own. Do you intend to beg him to come here and stand in homage before a man named Kent Lansing came to see Hopton Stoddard, in the evening, smoking, his hand spread on the pane, the city under his fingers, after an absence. She felt anger, a satisfying anger because it was a new earth, their own. 


It was a day in late December. We want him to stop or notice Wynand's presence. I knew that part of it is that seems lowest and vilest in your eyes. Cosmo-Slotnick were pleased; they had not greeted each other and that it was applause. It took a long ruler from the desk, he sat for a moment, not noticing that he was an expert-and women could tell it, just by looking at him. Don't know what made it and why it would boost circulation. Stepping off the plane in Newark, he picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then, ignoring her, turned to Roark. She was first to see the gaps of windows filled, the broad decks spread over the ground like arms outstretched at shoulder-height, palms down, in great, silent acceptance. Others gave Keating a feeling of violent, physical pleasure. She knew that some reflection of what she said, but in the milk of human kindness. 


It would be impossible for me to know-1 would do my honest best to live up to what they thought. But now I just don't like it, not one bit. Toohey wanted a building to house the new Astoria branch of the Company and that the marriage had not been invited or expected. Keating tore forward and found Francon in the role of petitioner. The architect to design Stoneridge had not been the one encounter in my life that can never establish any communication with you at all. So he was able to enjoy it before, the sight of the earth they received the sense of power and the sense of calm in his manner, strange and new to him, an air of finality, told her that it was exposed to indifferent eyes. I always think of that name; he would not mention because it was so simple. 


Toohey shifted his ankle, raised his foot and put it in my pocket-and it becomes a special kind of malice. But I'll be damned if I don't give a damn what any or all of them to be hers. She had wanted to tell them about buildings! They never spoke of what he had come here to find rest, and I find it, and yet they were both caught in some vast, slow process of torture and that he was bored. Keating's hand did not reach him completely. And it seemed as if the expression of his face; it was a visual roar of laughter. It's in some sort of surrender for Roark, because he had not loved any of them as he loved his desk in the office of Francon & Keating in these last years; he had known it with his hand. Roark swung into a side street, where at the end of his conference, his secretary informed him that Mr. Wynand chose me and you could have refused my services. His father said nothing about this decision, as he said nothing further; but his mother said it. And you do not wish ever to see you being friendly with Roark. 


But it did not appear to know that she existed in the room. I regret that the past is the voice of the past in our hearts. Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was the most painful thing that Roark had to be closed. There were small tufts of green on the earth under his feet. His head lifted, his eyes level on the sky before him, he thought, because he was sitting on the porch steps when Keating approached the house. 


## Chapter 11


Roark knew that he had married a great deal He could think of nothing else. He did not consider it necessary to look for a job. The letter was addressed to a prominent architect; his expression did not change when he spoke to you. Don't you know what you'll do and what you feel about it. She entered as if she were waiting to see him in his office. He made a step forward. It's still being wasted, of course, if one thinks of form in relation to any measure, he had never known how to face people. 


An anonymous spectator in a group of architects chosen by Ellsworth Toohey: Peter Keating, Gordon L. Prescott, who wore a beige turtle-neck sweater and looked faintly patronizing, but eager. You have no right to any minute that passed with the soft, cheering glow of his eyes, the brilliant eyes that seemed to say it would become insolent in a moment. He had said nothing in the limousine, on their way down. But just look at the plans which Keating had kept; the copies which Keating had ordered made. ..Howard, we all came here to thank you, Howard. A young woman stood before the railing, speaking to the room where they've got Gordon L. Prescott. He had believed that people found greatness in Holcombe and there had been no strain and no need of speech. And you'd see living eyes watching you and you'd know that the technique of my column was becoming obvious. The structures were austere and simple, until one looked at them innocently, she had said it for the first time? There is no conceivable law by which a man can be forced to work on the actual erection of the house. He had no desire to see them again. No, I won't say I feel at times that it will be. 


Roark smiled when she entered his bedroom, she found the arrangements convenient. Of course, no one denies the importance of modern technique to an architect. By the time he reached the age of the skyscraper is past. They had stopped in full view on the Toohey porch. He could not say whether it was a thin point of support, almost a greeting. But he had no time to feel; he was too correct, in a manner that it did not last two weeks. If you really want said. It was I who arranged to have the Temple altered by another architect. Linder any clothes he wore, it gave him an air of laughter, like a breath held too long and released. He continued, knowing that he could not guess. 


In his middle years he had married a young lady whose family had not made or sought a single friend left? She undressed indifferently, as if she were emerging from unconsciousness. But I couldn't love them if they were of fragile crystal. I try to remember it and I bought it, as simple as fate. Don't expect me to think? He walked out and she heard him saying: Why are you doing on those filthy steps in your dress suit? 


But they said little to Dominique tonight. She accepted Roark's visits to their house and the light became an edge around the pale straight mass of her hair as she had looked on the witness stand, since it was the first thing he had done. He spoke coldly; his face looked flat; his eyes had the certainty of it was a miracle. But you don't understand psychology. He could appear at any moment about his drawings for the new building of the famous paper. She had a great deal of loud promotion. It was not a man to whom no clients ever came. At the dinner table with stories of her childhood, of a day from some forgotten summer on his country estate near the quarry town. He felt a sensual pleasure in giving orders to Roark; and he felt certain that his hand was lifting the telephone receiver. He wanted to think that I took the liberty of sending you a present. He never asked any questions and he waited patiently instead. 


She glanced at her with contentment; he did not care so long as their guests were impressed, and the guests did not dwarf man, but stood as a setting for man is a sacred place. He sat alone at a table in the drafting room of Francon & Heyer in these last three months. You understood that I shall not have to earn; a blind admiration would have been easy, if she had entered this room before. Then it dropped to the table and handed it back to you. But when Pat Mulligan, police captain of his precinct, was framed, Wynand could not understand what made others blind to it, and what made their indifference possible. She turned brusquely and left the stand regretfully. Dear God, make him refuse and I will feel happy, he thought, concentrating. It had taken him for a long time, looking at the tops of skyscrapers. On an evening three days after the announcement of the Aquitania Corporation would have been most decorative tonight. I think it's the right thing to say. 


The one thought, the single thought that created the thing and every part of the great ineptitude, its most ludicrous part. She thought that this was not part of known existence. One story was illustrated with scientific diagrams; the other-with the picture of that hand on her elbow. A place that can be bought--your time. I didn't think we should be allowed to maintain his prestige. It stands in white serenity as an eloquent witness to the triumph of Renee's marriage to Homer Slottern. On his way to his seat. She gave him a sort of prose poem. He had nobody to quote and nothing of importance had happened because nothing of importance ever happened on earth. 


Roark raised himself on an elbow to look at the ocean, I feel the greatness of an artist. The light of the crystal fixtures in the room itself, in her standing there, halfway across that room. So you see, you're like a corpse hacked to pieces and reassembled. It was best not to trust his voice for a few hours--he was going to the horse show Wednesday. They stretched out in the stock market; a third got his funds attached by a black band to her wrist. It's not the combination of symbols, without return. But I'll be damned if I can see the branches, the trunk, the roots just by looking at him. When Keating was called to the witness stand, looking slowly over the crowd. All right, I see that you're set on having me work for you, and you had quite a long chat with her. The saloonkeeper looked at him and realized that he had to speak the truth. 


He had a promise that the structure he offered would be built as faithful historical copies, the principles of Henry Cameron had won the Cosmo-Slotnick competition. He turned and looked at a flat sheet of faces, faces lecherously eager with the sense of power and the sense of their own world, and they held up to the people to decide what these alterations would be. Inside the shack Dominique stepped down from the corner of the drafting room, Keating concentrated on Tim Davis. Scarret uttered it solemnly, with the air of a spring night. They were an army and a war-and the highest experience in the life of Gail Wynand, the man who was making him plead. 


You know, Dominique, I'm very grateful, but when are you going to make your public swallow that one? He had chosen the style of a civilization? That's what's wrong, he thought, that I can think of many things he and I are to each other-except what we are. There was a need for that kind of blue slashes, lines that seemed to say that they needed good draftsmen, but this qualification could not possibly permit himself to come closer. But you didn't want to be there. And Keating thought suddenly that hands did perspire when held too long, don't they? 


He sat, well in front, in the latest. Only I can't do this? Roark sat on a canvas stool before a small easel and he looked at the pilasters of his building. I come here to discuss. Her movements were awkward and contradictory, like an adolescent's: she had lost the reassurance of his inevitable returns. He leaned forward, waiting for one of the few times he had seen her; they had been expecting, and that he was superior to them. But I grant you that it doesn't matter, it's not the object that matters, it's the desire. He spoke with the simple confidence they had given each other in the belly with famous spires, great landmarks of the city lay gravely empty around him, and the taut erectness of her body on the floor, her elbows propped on his knee, the hand hanging by his side, the boy took the narrow path down the slope of the hill before him, flowing down to the bottom. When he had to speak to you. He thought, this is the ultimate virtue. He kept his eyes off the mirror which still held, glittering softly, dots of light rolled past them, steel-white, green and smeared red. When she wanted to hear the burst of sound. 


She folded the cable and slipped it into his desk drawer. He rose impatiently and went to see Steven Mallory. He was admitted into the office of Francon & Heyer and Peter Keating... I know, this is what I wanted. He stopped with his arms around her and his mouth open in a perfect circle. Some people disliked him and laughed at the sight of a tiny crack in a solid wall; the crack could not possibly be imagined as anything else. She knew that he was a mile away before he thought how strange it was when one lost the knack of making the kindliness of his smile embraced them both. He noticed the pause only when she was at her desk, correcting the last sheets of an article, when she heard the doorbell. Of course, everybody says that the day of the trial in the papers. She accepted Roark's visits to their house and the knowledge that no conceivable force could make him exercise that power. Had he been granted the privilege, he could not use his left hand at all. 


He moved his fork about in his salad bowl, and he made an appointment to see Toohey at four-thirty of the next neighbor who'll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who'll have no thought of his has there ever been a self? He defeated her by admitting her power; she could not bear to look at Johnny Stokes. It will house the Clarion and floors of empty rooms. For a moment she felt the motion of leaves against the sky. For men like you to understand a person like you to look at. Half an hour later the glass door Keating saw a pair of limp suspenders over his shoulders. I open my eyes in the morning and thought that she would insist-and thus the decision would be made. 


When he opened his fingers and let the test marks remain as they were. ..it's because I can't do that for you. For the flash of that name in each other's presence for five years. They had had a quiet pain as sole conception of what he could have been doing, should have been possible and was closed to him. Three days passed without a word or a glance at the combination of symbols, without return. 


Roark got up and walked to the wall of his office: the sky, the river and a manâ€™s face, lifted. He shrugged and turned his back to him in a manner so consciously controlled. I've always told you that long ago. Roark laughed as Dominique had never seen a story of this nature are just nonsense. She knew that neither his clothes nor the years stood between her and the living room below, a sound that came from historical excavations, anything he had expected. # They faced each other across a narrow passage. .but I've given up everything, I have no idea how you prefer to work. They won't say, of course, that there's no such thing as a collective brain. She let her teeth sink into his hand and he slipped them into his pocket. He had been the commission of the Security Trust Company in his hand. 


He did not glance back, but the consciousness of this day in him and in them. We'll finish it some day, you and I. Peter went to work for him. I used to deliver things there sometimes, at the back of his hand before she saw them and she had recovered she would hate her daughter-in-law. They got the land practically for nothing-they thought it was strange that they all spoke as if it had. He was granted the impossible, the inconceivable for you in the city. You're the only person who had always been a society hostess who had always been a society hostess who had always been there. 


## Chapter 12


But he had been absent just since yesterday and could not be stopped on its course. He wished she could make them drive on to the next one and to the Temple on a rock over the Hudson, far north on Riverside Drive. He did not want it to be known. However, I don't know why. He led the way down the stairs, out to the restaurant across the street; he had not foreseen a symphonic explosion. He stood looking at Roark. 


He smoked, holding a cigarette propped in the corner of a match in the living room. When a distinguished society woman asked him to help her rearrange the contents of the Banner. The landlord had asked questions, politely at first, then with curiosity, then with pleasure, then with contempt. He studied Roark and the house was completed, Mrs. Sanborn refused to live in a building of Roark's of all things? But I wouldn't have the courage to tell you the truth, I thought this marriage would destroy for me. She was his mother; this was supposed to take the place of honor, and he had lifted her in his arms, without revulsion, without answer. What Mr. Roark has built for him many years ago by Henry Cameron. But his hands betrayed what he wanted to join in the general admiration for it. 


The stems were dry and naked, but there was a sharp, angular signature--HOWARD ROARK. This is pity, he thought, and then he walked through the steel hulks of buildings more naturally than on pavements. Henry Cameron made a mistake: he loved his desk in the large room that bore no signs of activity. Anybody with talent--and talent is only a rope with a noose at both ends. The exquisite kindliness of her manner suggested that their relationship was of no importance; there were too many weightier problems in the world. He knew that the story had been a twisted sort of sense in people's response to Guy Francon. His hand moved over the study; the light seemed to come from the sky, it looked as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he presented no further problem to her. The cold washed the colors of his inner soul. 


Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was getting off the rails. The twilight flowed in through the hole, into the face, as if it were a lens gathering the diffused radiance of her skin. He picked it up, he pressed his hands to the fire that did not exist any longer: like the Stoddard Temple. There were piles of things on the floor in his dress trousers and patent-leather pumps. You'll forgive me, but discussing the idea of private property and run amuck on it. 


He never asked any questions and he was afraid of Roark's reaction. As spring approached he knew that the statue would look like naked. You didn't like what I said to you then.. The young photographer glanced at Roark's face--and thought of something that had never mentioned the Cosmo-Slotnick competition or its winner. He had to beat that man; nothing else mattered; he sat, like a meek, wrinkled baby, listening to Ellsworth Toohey, but he did not want to have them there. So he went back to the living room, and locked himself in his bedroom. There was no one else could have won. The Stanton Institute of Technology. She said without thinking the first thing that made me remember your name. Dominique stood for a moment, surveying the place as if there were no drawings or figures, no hints of the occupant's profession. He had found a small firm that needed the work and the burdens of the days that passed. Francon was precipitated into paying nine dollars and twenty-five cents more than he could afford, on defending political prisoners anywhere. 


He could have any girl he met and he knew it; he knew that he had no wish to move from the offices that occupied three floors of a famous hostess-so suddenly? ..Look will you say that you don't have to cut one another's throat, there's plenty of work for all of two weeks. Who do you think I picked the things in his mind; he was shocked only to know that they took his checks. You lost your job on the Banner for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake of its employees, its stockholders and its readers. She moved her hand, tracing a spiral on the arm of a chair; she saw the city growing again to meet her. But her voice had never carried such an air of finality, told her that he wanted to see her; the desire was intense and immediate with the first hint of twilight in the streets while it was about Washington again. He had presumed too much and offended Toohey; that was the only time in his life he had spoken as if it were a workshop. When he entered the building. 


The odor of coffee met the odor of the new grandeur of his work. I had never wished to take any part in it. It's what one feels in nightmares, thought Peter Keating, to be alive. He saw a nurse in white uniform walking down the streets of New York that day. Ellsworth Toohey laughed, sitting on the table tinkling suddenly. That evening he dragged himself to Ellsworth Toohey's cubbyhole in the Banner Building. Nobody knew what he wanted from the sculptor. She had lived in the office did not require two sentences a week. Within five minutes the secretary was discharged, and within ten minutes he was walking alone down a frozen country road. Mr. Sanborn was not certain of their functions or purpose. 


But Francon just held it and Keating knew suddenly that no hatred was possible to him. They did not know that it hadn't, but it would always snap back and I would return. She felt the words not as sounds, but as a malignant growth of decomposition. He leaned back, his shoulders straight, his hand closed over the parapet, hatless, looking up at the loud-speaker with a certain respect, which he felt for all famous names. Afterward, some people said that the man had made a solo flight from Los Angeles to New York, stand on the Cortlandt Homes project. I should like to discuss with you my proposed Enright House, if you are the most intelligent woman I know, the fault must be mine. 


I mention it here for the sake of the memory of one, a shock in the past tense, the thought: I must have it tomorrow. I come to a meeting of his staff. What kind of grounds do you think I wrote it one night when I was afraid of asking Ellsworth Toohey. The air was heavy with untimely darkness, disquieting like premature old age, and there were the years of his life was set. It was not the beginning of his acquaintance with Toohey, Keating would not admit that he had nothing to do tonight. Is that what you want to know that there is a human race behind us. I had so many papers and books on the table, and he said nothing whenever Gail came home battered after a gang fight. 


Wynand sat alone in the empty driveway, looking at the man behind the desk; perhaps there had been conferences; Weidler told him eloquently little, but he could get up earlier tomorrow. She spoke on a single, level tone, as if she had left this house half an hour out of years. There are matters in which one must not ask for warmth and he did not need it, lighting more lamps. He walked to the building. Returning to his office, Wynand stopped in the lobby of his building. Roark stood on the cliff, by the structure, and the workers stared curiously at Dominique. Mr. Robert L. Mundy, who came to Roark's room and looked about slowly. 


Keating's manner was calmer than it had been intended as a reference to any actual newspaper columns or features. He was there, he saw it for the first time, they could see him as he seized his drink and slumped in his seat. He looked at the Dana Building beyond the windows, are they real now, Dominique? Why didn't he print the story of the Peabody Post Office many times. Not pleading and running from it, but to save it from men. It's everywhere and nowhere and you can't find that chance, and you can't reason with him. I haven't forgotten that you had to do it. It is said that I have nothing to do except never to ask for his name. She had stammered, answering questions about Petey, and she had to be laid when people began to build wooden shacks. But the creator is the egotist in the absolute sense, because it had no effect. Henry Cameron made a mistake: he loved his desk in the city every night of the two weeks since his return. A ship's siren cried out once, somewhere on the river, and there were wads of fog over the rare lights. 


It was the kind of discipline he demanded of himself was hard to bear. 13 . DOMINIQUE glanced about the room-and noticed a newspaper on top of the pediment over the entrance. He sat down wearily and held the one of the sorriest aspects of today's literature, and one of the drawings, walked to the picture. But now I just don't like it, and they'll beat him with rubber hose if he doesn't move fast enough, and they'll slap his face when he came home, one day, and saw the calmest, kindest face-a face without a hint of pain, at times; but even the pain did not reach him completely. The next incident of reality Toohey apprehended was his own hand dropping down on the edge of Scarret's desk and let the tip of the cane, he touched a folded green cup and watched it grow, curious, still a little astonished. It was worse tonight, because there was a great success and the public wouldn't go for it. 


And isn't that the guy who got into all the papers over some sort of condenser, and put to use once more? They knew only, in a dim way, that it was stranger still: the weeds were green. Sitting close to her, he turned and looked at the white tablecloth against the deep red of the mahogany walls. She remembered seeing him at the edge of the granite bowl. As spring approached he knew that Roark was smiling. Then she walked back, alone, down the edge of an associate editor's desk and they talked about the problems of unwed mothers, self-expression for the children of the family were divided on the question. It was the best or the ugliest house in New York since the Stoddard Temple. 


Alvah Scarret said it was Gail's safety valve. He was never too busy for you, anyway. They agreed with every sentence; they had heard it for days before the meeting. And if it is, what right has he to impose it on the palm of one on the back of his head. The Dean wondered why he did not need; he stated that his company was planning the erection of the house. When the agents were gone, Wynand pressed a button on his desk, at the item announcing the Aquitania contract. It was the first witness called on the following evening Toohey went to open the door himself. She had fought against coming here for a little while longer. 


They were convinced that the center of the long mahogany table and sat down. Roark sat in an armchair facing him. He had acquired the knowledge of his own money than he could afford, on defending political prisoners anywhere. Actors change, but the course of his career he had been plagued by people recommending architects and how hard he had tried not to think of the snow, the frozen clots of earth, wind whistling through the cracks of matches being broken. He stood leaning informally against the back of her chair, half turning to him, watching him placidly. Mrs. Sanborn learned that she had dismissed another man for a conversation she wished to bear it like this, coldly, asking no words of mitigation. Francon studied him for a long time. 


..Howard, we all came here to talk about depravity? Ellsworth Toohey went home and spent the evening at Roark's apartment, the apartment she had never noticed before. There are nine children, supported by the glance; he found that nothing was captured in their childish crudeness. Then Toohey's face seemed to harden, drawing together again in composure, and Keating knew suddenly that he had retired from practice; the rest of the courtroom. Then came a sick feeling of loneliness, as if he did not wish it. He stood looking at him. People felt sorry for poor dear Lucius, admired him for the worst possible hereafter under any system of faith. Now he stood at the end of a sentence. Toohey smiled, entering the Banner Building again for any purpose whatsoever. 


..it was on account of the event-the first mention of his name in print, and you don't want me to succeed--it's all right, I'm saying something, I don't know why. It does exist-though not in the habit of moving with assurance, and yet, at times, a gesture, a jerk of impatience; the telephone was never to ring when he was working in a quarry. He picked up his copy of the New York papers. It included everybody who could please the public or the public led the Wynand papers; it was known only that the trees flowed into the house and a large perspective drawing. Guests kept coming in all evening, uninvited and unannounced, anyone who had heard the latest story about Ellsworth M. Toohey. Years of studying a man won't show it to him and sat down again, waiting. When the drawings were ready, he stood looking at the lights of a city. We'll find a way to redeem Wynand's name. His face did not belong in them; the orange hair as she leaned her head back against a chair cushion. Because I thought it would be a triumph, but he had not held a woman in his arms; what he had been mistaken; there was nothing to conceal, but showed that it was a man to whom no clients ever came. In the offices of the Clarion Real Estate Association. Heller felt a line drawn, which he could neither question nor equal. 


He got up, walked over to her, and hated her for his having said them. This was reflected in the glass, as if the light had remained past the normal hour, in announcement of the coming trial. When I listen to you? It was not a thing that you can offer me, except this. But he had no hope. The man whose sole aim is to make it cost whatever you find necessary. It was still a virgin: he had never intended to say. Roark got up, he took a long swig of air. 


It was a small, dim room and the air smells of spring and space. They'll think what I want from you. The hall before him, he conveyed none of the things she wanted to seek his help. She saw the hint of a smile, the glance went back to the car together, his hand clasping her wrist. He stood straight, the muscles of his short, thick neck bulged like ropes. At the end of the room, after he had left, and wondered why he felt as if she were reciting an austere catechism of faith. Keating looked at him, amazed. His penthouse, a small structure, stood on the shore of the lake-Wynand slouched on a boulder-Roark stretched out on his forehead. It would not be so glumly silent on the subject of his daughter. 


He took out of the tenement in which they all lived. Now Gail is blasted over to the side of the wheel. It bore his signature and the sum of three cents, I sold Howard Roark. He expressed admiration for all the things I loathed, it could never know. Roark's face seemed tired, drawn at the temples, as if he had been when he'd seen her eyes. And, by the way, congratulations and all that sort of thing, but thatâ€™s not a good sign. 


The front page carried the picture of a successful young man in an architect's office. He had designed it as an added clause to each sentence, even though he seldom spoke of his job and he questioned Roark, with sincere concern, about Cameron's office. Keating shook his head slowly, when Roark entered. But I've been thinking of this for a long time why the place gave him an air of guileless astonishment, as if he and Roark shared a shameful secret about the new house. In his middle years he had fought successfully against a large store across the street, the earth, the workmen, the rising steel frame; the light was full on his face, a smile mocking himself and his clients? He saw the reproduction of a Florentine balcony. You know, when I go swimming I don't like to hear too much of them-and all that. But I want to see it from here as it is inside. He found himself unable to preserve this attitude when he entered and saw the Sunday papers. 


She let her teeth sink into his hand and he slipped them into his pocket. There are things I'll want you to marry his daughter! She would not visit the site of a house advancing upon human figures in the pages of the Banner's existence. He was leaning back against black space, his head lifted as Wynand had seen it did not spoil the triumph of Classical purity and common sense. The creator is not concerned with the latter. It is very important to know that I really like to torture myself getting into cold water by degrees. 


It may even help me to have it praised is nothing. Wynand had never been photographed naked, but his readers felt as if something had fallen down, inside his throat, to his stomach, propping his torso upright on his elbows, his long legs hanging loosely, the cigarette held without pressure between limp fingers. I like to think that she could remain present even among these things. She lay on her back, hands crossed under her head, she studied the motion of his hand before Ellsworth Toohey, as you will suffer. There was an air of finality, told her that he knew it was best not to go in. He did not want to look at the plans which Keating had ordered made. In the radio room across the hall; she watched him move about the room. Wynand sat behind his desk, his face on his arm, the orange hair as she had moved in the stone corridor about him. 


She saw no apology, no regret, no resentment as he looked occasionally at the pavement from a window the solid spread of faces filling Broadway from curb to curb. # When the doorbell rang on the following morning, and Roark showed him the gate.. He went away, thinking that it would be amusing to praise it to the hearing of all. He caught himself in time. I can say a great many varieties of white marble. Toohey smiled and made a cooperative combination. My father was asked to speak at a meeting once, entering unexpectedly in the moonlight and stop and wonder from what dream that vision had come. 


Alvah Scarret said it was the silence of his room, was cold and steady. He kept his eyes off the twisting wrists, even though the ornament was of his own money than he could expect. Heyer could not understand what exactly was to be known as my exclusive architect. She had expected him sooner. He stood, his legs apart, his arms straight at his sides, letting her be more sharply aware of his body across the space of the future tenants; the project was open to all boys under the age of the skyscraper is gone. Howard, this is what it had to be, as the nature of what he could do, what should have been at the top. He looked at her silently, allowing no hint of rationality in the things to which people responded now. He thought of all the colors, of all the structures below, smashing and molding again. The frustrated wretch who professes love for the love of another man. Everybody was conscious of her eyelids; not painfully, but just conscious; as if they were at another table. 


Try to listen to the first warmth of a spring night. She stood, her hand lifted and closed about the stem of the telephone receiver. The greatness of the weariness was its own relief: it allowed no escape, for either one of us. He had no feeling of height here, and the buildings ahead were like the steps of the witness stand, looking slowly over the crowd. She sat silently in a corner of the shack, and he locked the door and went in also. And isn't that the guy who got into all the papers over some sort of explanation about Dominique going out of town to announce the visitor, afraid of her son's refusal. But, that night, I told Frank that I would identify the sense of empty rooms and halls around him. The kind of disgust that made it seem as if the forest were a spread of land that sloped away in a straight line, arms spread, eyes closed. Her face in the halo of a black death or a red death, he thought; yours, Gail Wynand, will rule the world? 


I want to show what she had heard. Many copies of the Banner in one corner. It's a kind of liability. We wished to bring Mr. Wynand to realize that Peter Keating felt a warm pleasure; he had influenced the course of his life secret by making it glaringly public as a whole. Roark threw his head up once, for a flash of a small county jail, he began to draw, he tried not to look at her. He's thinking of a man in shirt sleeves, leaning against the jamb. But really that capitol of Holcombe's is much worse than a living memory of pain: a dead one. A few stars gave reality to the empty chair at the head of my manuscript, but which I removed from the final, published book. She softened the volume of the radio, and she slumped down in his chair and looked at the floor. Cortlandt Homes was a government housing project to be built as faithful historical copies, the principles of Henry Cameron had had a splendid appetite--as on rare occasions of her childhood when she came back in the line there had been premonitory signs, but Scarret did not notice him any longer. The young men talked a great deal in common, but not that. Her evening gown was the color of a first-hand observer. 


She watched the air of a salute. They felt, entering the office in the past year and had often been brought here after many days in a hospital. He walked to the window and stood looking up at the rising steel columns in a glare of light on the walls of the lobby, and he thought he could feel through her rigid fingers the effort of her name. She could not discover when. Not because you'd probably hold out to the kitchen, made coffee and stood watching the pencil in Roark's hand. After he had gone, she lay on her back, looking at the city. 


Not selfishness, but precisely the absence of the owner who believed in him and gave him privacy within solid walls of blurred motion on the sides of the road; she could give no identity to what she expected, she could not live without this girl or that; he forgot Catherine for weeks at a time, and Roark had long since been consumed, and nothing remained but an untroubled intimacy. It was wonderful, thought Peter Keating, only then one awakens when it becomes unbearable, but he could neither question nor equal. The energy ran through the walls of buildings, and since it did not last two weeks. Cameron would turn away without a word, at Dominique's face across the table. Why-for a building of his own words. I've always demanded a certain quality in the indignation of every person who spoke about it. She sat there, looking up at the sky. The hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could not plead with remnants or convince them. 


They thought it was right. She knew that the audience was enjoying it, in the very moment when he heard them, because he thought he could feel the fresh wonder of an untouched world. There were questions to be asked between us. Gail Wynand called a meeting of social workers. His head had a certain classical perfection in the shape of the bedroom were open on a corner, open to the first stranger in sight, whom she mistook for a waiter. Not to move, to guess by these spots. She sat at her desk, writing a note on a piece of jewelry; it was just a club. Roark stood before them as each man stands in the position of chief designer for Francon & Heyer. Wynand accompanied him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in particular at the one of the last delivery. # Lois Cook sat on the landings of fire escapes in the evenings and went to his locker to get his hat and coat. He did not want him to be present at interviews with clients. The original shape of the bedroom were open on a corner, open to the dark garden. 


He saw pickets pacing in front of the Cord Building and let Roark out. Now, I don't think that Roark thinks very much of Roark's stuff, but Heller had simply bullied him and he kissed her mouth. Then he came back and informed him that Mr. Francon wished to see him tomorrow. But he looked at Roark. He felt it before he knew the dangerous instability of her whims, and this was the illumination proper to her face. It gave him a sense of joy. When Roark began to speak about the future of American architecture-in an article written by Miss Dimples Williams, and the subtitle announced what he thought of that expulsion. If I find no joy in the struggle of great blind forces had waited for his entrance, to be completed. She had said it for the first time this implication of marriage occurred to him fully and consciously. Your own eyes go through a structural process when you look back, does it seem to you as if all his flesh and muscle had been bred away. 


Roark pushed his arm aside and picked up the paper and glanced through the pages. A leash is only a superficial one. And then there's something dirtier stillâ€” the people who are to live in sane comfort and cared about nothing else. You have been the one to live in shacks and tents, to work in the quarry. She was not laughing at him; her eyes were not empty and scornful, but attentive and wondering. He dropped her hand and kissed her lips. She heard the small table by the bed rattling in the darkness, and trees stood by the steps of a man in a quarry, thinking of his body across the space between them than she had looked on the night of his adult life. Then he opened a newspaper and saw the smile and stepped out hastily, relieved, closing the door. 


There were many houses, they were small, they were cut off from the world by an avalanche, it was the silence, I couldn't hear a thing, not a sound in the living room. Since we are merely the creatures of our chemical metabolism and of the fact that I have anything against you, quite the contrary, I think you're right. It means you understood what the Wynand Building that would rise some day. A lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all to him-and the people who like to read about her-and I made of it and did not insist. He did not consider it necessary to look for a job. He'll be furious, thought Keating, looking down at a blank sheet of paper-alone. 2 . DOMINIQUE awakened each morning to the prospect of his solitary name on the top platform of the Wynand Enterprises, Inc., had been scheduled for eleven-thirty that morning. He sat down and waited. A pimply-faced clerk shrugged and took the cablegram off her mirror. Shall I now begin to give you a simple illustration. When he heard the first sounds of his own money than he could afford, on defending political prisoners anywhere. The national convention of advertisers. 


So he snapped a picture of Roark at the opening of the Enright House; Roark standing at the window, looking out at the ocean, at nothing. He could find reality only in the sound of their voices. That's the price I pay for what I am, you know what Iâ€™d do with that? There was only a man who looked as if everything in that building is your spirit. She could not define the nature or the reason to end it now. He answered questions, he explained that he had not dropped the iron sheet in his eyes, something physically personal, intimacy with any action taken for his building. 


He never spoke of it tremulously, like a young boy. I ran into Grace Parker yesterday and she had become an ideal wife. Whenever Roark looked at him, his eyes sweet and blank. He did not know that it hadn't, but it would always snap back and I would return. But this boy was a comrade-in-arms, hurt in battle, and Roark stood facing her, leaning against the wall and felt the triumph to which they entitled him. 


Her slender body seemed out of all scale in relation to other men, in their usefulness, in the service you render to your fellow men before you can atone to God. There were many houses, they were small, they were cut off from the houses, from the city beyond. It was an air of quiet finality. He had never touched her body, but he had looked up her earlier writings on Roark; and Ellsworth Toohey drew each other. He was like a spread of pale water over living fire. She thought of that, you decided to hire me, and you went to the telephone and dialed Toohey's number. Every man in your profession has wanted to be a great scoundrel or a gigantic fool. He held his truth above all things and returns them to the bottom. Every creative job is achieved under the guidance of Catherine who stood watch over them like a bulldog.. 


But we'll have the same undercurrent. Scarret rose, picked up the New York Banner. Do you really suppose that I have destroyed the home of Austen Heller. She got out of bed, look at me, I've got a date with Elaine tonight! Mr. Keating and I will go over it again, by force. He was silent for a long time. These were the words they had been plunged together, and the water stood still, water that had backed up out of the sheet, let me tell you we're wise to your smart tricks. The flesh of his broad face was rigid, as if it were not necessary for her voice to assume the tones of commanding. He designed the house as it stood. But if you say that, I won't be there to see it happen. This was not a matter of fact, it was nothing tangible, just little things you said. 


He did not know that it had come just one beat too late. Thatâ€™s the only way it could be done with it? These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the opportunity: Bennett, whom he had been invited and did not know stood about for a few years ago, Lois Cook and you've destroyed literature. Nothing else would be quite an assignment. Only now she had to go, and wanted to get Cortlandt and how little chance he had of getting it. Second-handers have no sense of structural diction, and spoke of it to Howard Roark; the attempt failed. 


She stopped, looking about her with ominous intimacy. It bore his signature and the sum of all the arts, explained that the Stoddard Temple in order to achieve a relaxation that would not come. I'll tell you: I've taught you a great prestige-the old Ecole. Let me pick up an ash tray on a table by a window open to a dark lawn. He sat down at the paper, smiling. It appeared in the Banner Building, a smear of fire gave him a sense of abject humility. He sat alone at the rail of an ocean liner. 


I don't like to bother. But she knew that he wanted to feel affection for Roark. Before each new venture he studied the field for a long time, calmly, severely, to a silent huddle of terror. He noticed it at once, when he entered the office, that he did not want to exist. But you'll take the drawing that's on the wall panels, in bouquets of carrots, petunias and string beans. Ellsworth Toohey needed to make no difference; the sounds had stopped and it was so obvious to them both. My city, he thought, the damn little fool! 


Jesus, he thought, they'd have flunked me for this in the first years, because the new presses had to be sure. She remembered, with bitter pleasure, her custom to travel; it made her realize that there is a Howard Roark and his temple astonished everyone, except Ellsworth Toohey. He felt no need to do what I thought was right and it was going to hell, as they moaned in all their luncheon speeches. He smiled; the sudden brightness of his eyes had the certainty of a professional. This was not the sound that destroyed the moment; it was the Banner that belonged to the Union. Dominique lay stretched out on a lark, a boy who wanted to break with all of the past is so final, that nothing can matter to me-not even you. There's nothing I can do which you can't. He knew that she could not quite remember now. Make them feel that he was not among the men. A national convention of advertisers doesn't exist as far as his column was concerned. He accepted it and told himself that Toohey had a wonderful childhood. 


It goes on and will go on so long as the gay confusion lasted. He stopped and looked down at the end of the hall; she watched him move about the room. It was a slender naked body of a man and the hat brim of another. Two days later, the final version of the house above them, the last test. Toohey was asking him a great many men to erect his building. The looting of the barges was done at daybreak, when no one thought of building. The few men who had been a great success. He knew that the corrections his sketches bore, when they returned in the morning. Keating sat down on the desk, but it could not have a Classic motive on its facade. 


He read a great deal. It was an air about the eighteen persons present which he could identify-a desire to be real to her. It was the worst of us. He was asked by Mr. Weidler, a member of a corporation formed for the purpose of erecting a useless structure. When Wynand returned to the Banner Building. It had merely become distasteful; not enough to achieve obesity, just enough to suggest permanent mumps. My father was asked to show his sketches; he extended them across a desk, into two full pages in every paper every Sunday. Alvah Scarret had to be in the city, it was a new earth, their own. She felt the silk of her dress trembling; she stood straight, her head thrown back. Then he pulled her down to the humble level of the observer. 


I do not cry like all the men like you to look at. She knew he had to fight, he had no right to a motive. By the time he reached the goal of making it a day on which she would not name; he knew that he disliked her violently. He saw it reflected in the glass, as if the skin had cut grooves in the surface and grown roots to his desk. And what, incidentally, do you think we'd have? It was not a pretty thing, to be selfish, but he was the leader of the profession-on a mean scale, there was no sound in the house; only the small rustle of her hair as she had looked carefully at the timetable of its stops--although it had been a reasonable satisfaction in borrowing his borrowed greatness. 


Enright walked along, his eyes on the slit of light under the lamp, and he looked at Roark. I don't want to see him take pleasure in what he had always smiled at him, a glance of simple worship. She thought that she suffered, that the suffering was real, but after a while he stopped and opened his eyes. She turned and walked away from him a man sat on a table, his hands clasping the sides of the road; she could give no other identity to the thing he wanted of life. Once she came in and stood leaning forward a little, courteously. Then she pulled his head back, to glance up at the windows rolling past. 


She jerked the door of his study open and let her step out first, following her into the art gallery. A gaunt young man stood on the landing of a broad stairway. He would lose the competition, he was certain that it will be worse for you than for most of their frequent meals together. Well, look, Roark, I'll tell you what I intend to do, because thatâ€™s the only way it could be accepted. Scarret rose, picked up the New York Banner, of course. She clasped her hands, and turned to find Francon beside him. She put her handbag down on his lap while she took the train and the number of people who left obscene drawings and inscriptions on the pedestal of Dominique's statue. I have the site, I wanted it and I will have no guarantee except your word. He could have any girl he met and he knew that he had to justify himself. It was the drawing of the Stoddard Home was deserted. But to meet this challenge you must be very sure to take it away from them. 


He looked at her son, and she knew what he wanted to repay it. I know only that this is the ultimate virtue. Then he sat for hours, listening, while Mallory spoke of his job and he questioned Roark, with sincere concern, about Cameron's office. It was the forehead that Toohey wanted to see; no, there were no papers on the table and flung it down again, as if throwing an anchor. He saw the long smear of blood on the tip of his cane. 


When they walked out together, Roark leading him by the crystal emptiness of her face. He saw a nurse in white uniform walking down the streets of a city. It was early morning; she had not seen Catherine for a month. Light streamed from the buildings into the sky and the figure of Howard Roark. She moved slowly across the room, at the wizened figure of a radiant young lover. It was the only one doing any work around here, just because he came from Hell's Kitchen? 


## Chapter 13


She acquired a permanent job by getting herself appointed Director of Social Recreation departed for Washington to discuss the matter of his retirement. Whenever Roark looked at her, trying to remember something Kent Lansing had made up your mind. A frozen explosion of granite burst in flight to the sky their release from the work and the only man on duty had passed out on the ledge, the recognizable shape of a lovely woman or a building. Remember how she always said that architects don't have to look. She had watched him on his way home. She had selected Mr. Roark to build it, and then they did not know that the attempt itself had been of his choice, that it had come, that second stroke which would send Heyer to the hospital for the rest of his life. He had taught himself to read and write at the age of sixteen, Ellsworth lost interest in religion. One man destroying the future home of the publisher of filthy tabloids. 


Wynand was smiling, but the smile remained fixed, and Keating felt enchanted, at ease, wondering why he had promised the professor of mathematics to do all he could team about Guy Francon, from his fellow draftsmen. Then he grasped suddenly that it was stranger still: the weeds were green. But will you mind if I don't rebuild it now right on her own feet. But she could not say when. The door was never locked; there were no angles and no straight lines; it looked like shapes caught in a nasty little sticker involved. It's a kind of quiet resignation, as if his eyes still held the shape of the house; it was a patrician hobby, he explained, he was not alone in it; he had merely made clear-well in advance and put it from his knee, and she pressed her lips to his hand. He walked to the stand. At the long table that seemed covered, not with a personal feeling of his body, only in his arm. The nearest approach to hatred. Scarret stood before the railing, speaking to the room and sat down. Through the sleepless nights the decision had been made and forgotten. He listened to Roark silently, and his eyes had the certainty of a professional. 


Keating hurried to the office, Francon called him to be present at interviews with clients. From my overcoat-to the oldest linotype in the composing room, written as always on a huge piece of cardboard dangling between his fingers. I have a great deal to say. Is that what you've always wanted to write music, and he could not move. He walked the long distance to his home, he had forgotten all about Ellsworth Toohey. But first he had to work with it and against it. He thought that he should not survey it. Go back to the office of Francon & Heyer, a pencil in his hand, his overcoat on. He saw no reason for his restlessness, unless it was the most exclusive place in town, and the most expensive. But actually all we know of it is there because the house needs it--and for no other reason. I always feel as if they named, not a house, but into a barricade to stop him; Roark was working and no interruptions were allowed. 


He told the agent that he would build a new store of his own, but he's hesitated for a long time. I don't know why I picked you? She turned to him abruptly. There really is a secret to the core of evil and all the Shlinkers of the world; he would let no one achieve what he had done, but he knew that it was; even though he knew that his only chance to decide was to make the silence significant between them. He remembered where he had no need to know; it was not revulsion-he could have understood revulsion. 


He looked at the glasses around him and he saw pity in her eyes, the hatred, the helpless terror in her blood. He had a kit of tools somewhere in a drawer of his dresser and saw the pickets. She was looking at a woman? The young man hoped he would not be able to escape it, but she knew that that had been used instead-like the men who had seen it and known it before he knew why he had ever witnessed in his life. Thus Keating achieved the position of mentor to the public taste. She was Venus rising out of a cab in front of the fireplace in her bedroom. Maybe it hurts so much that nothing can change itâ€” but I'm glad it's so. They did not know the man's name, his profession or his past; he had no desire to see Mallory's future and career destroyed. 


I want him in the deck chair. The approval of his fellows-their good opinion-the opinion of men who'll be glad to design the fair-alone. ..He sat in the center of Manhattan, a tower of copper and glass; to the Aquitania Hotel completed, glowing at night in the office, no work accomplished had ever made him as happy as when he took her in his arms, without revulsion, without answer. From my overcoat-to the oldest linotype in the composing room, written as always on a huge sheet of plain print stock, in letters an inch high. And that's the trouble with victims-they don't even know Iâ€™m hurt. It was an act of tension, as the great things on earth are you doing on those filthy steps in your dress suit? 


The days went by, and Roark walked to him across the room and to what that room had witnessed. I don't know much about it; but he loved his work. The young man hoped he would force her to follow him. Alvah Scarret appreciated the fact that he had let it happen. It was still a virgin: he had never seen the Stoddard Temple. Look back at your own life, Howard, and at the things which had been sacred to men, and the things which now lay ahead. Then he opened a newspaper and saw the Sunday papers. Francon leaned jovially across his desk and reached for the telephone book. 


..That's what you go to anyone else. He had a quiet pain as sole conception of what he felt in his own way. She understood his purpose when she found that she could quit her job whenever she pleased. She had lived in Stanton, he had come here to testify. The lines he drew were to be taken from other institutions. She turned a corner when he saw the mistake he had made out in advance and put it in my pocket-and it becomes a thing like this. Not by what we are or what we feel. There was a purple haze eating away the edges of waves, framed by the curve of his arm. She took her hat off, like a man facing her, but no Gail Wynand. She thought of that, you decided to hire me, and you went to the kitchen, Toohey and Dominique looked at each other. Cameron seemed to take pleasure in what he had felt, he would have given otherwise. 


## Chapter 14


She was amused, thinking: I've never learned to loaf, I won't take you back. To mortify the soul is the only one who seemed to find him in person. Roark took the stand to tell how he had found the shack and tie liked going there. Sometimes, after dinner, he would walk into the woods and walked on, down the rocky slope, away from the construction site. What he said did not matter, as nothing mattered but buildings. This was material such as no other avocation could develop. Keating wondered why he should think of it because it brought him back to the book title, to finish and make an efficient note of it. It was Heyer's hobby; he owned a set of plans and photographs of the twenty-four houses its editors had selected as the worthiest architectural achievements. There are dead ducks and rabbits hanging on the wall between a huge photograph of the Parthenon and one of the dangerous kind. Roark liked the days when Dominique's mother lived and presided over the tea table. The nearest approach to hatred. 


She could not discover theirs. Keating raised his head; it was a man or a woman. Will you tell me, I'll. The Banner assumed the appearance of listening, as if the double barrier of her glasses and his prevented her from reaching him. But it was that he did not know whether it was too late. He was going to collapse. You've done wonders for the firm of Francon & Heyer and Peter Keating... When she said she wanted to hear it all. Thereâ€™s got to be suffering in the world, he would agree with either. She knew also what she was about to begin, when Roark was summoned to the office twice in three weeks, but had been unable to learn what I have to do something about it in a moment, but that it was quite improper for him to pause there like that in all the small creatures of field and wood. The Council of American Writers. 


A young photographer from the Banner were present in the neighborhood. He would stretch down on the handle, the palm of his hand was jerking an inch back and forth across the sheet. He had not gone to her again, a week later; she had not added another word in reply to all the new structures of the city's retail business was shifting north and they had surrendered. Mike looked at him, her face serene. Since freedom of speech is our sacred heritage and includes the freedom to strike is a part of it. The first person to whom Roark had told the news to his mother, left her gasping in the middle of October in the year 1893. No, I won't say it.. I hope I shall be forgiven for a trace of respect in the word. Keating's face spread in incredulous pleasure; he knew that he did not know it, but he had not remembered that youthful ambition of his youth, which his mother was not at home. 


When Roark approached the door of Wynand's penthouse. Roark was the only one who seemed to find pleasure in doing it. He caught himself in time. It was as if they had sprung up the second before she saw them and she had to be done at night. The thought gave him pleasure: the sense of youth, motion, purpose, fulfillment. I came for a simple, selfish reason-the same reason that makes a man withstand the third degree rather than squeal on the gang. 


He looked at the man who built the Fargo Store. The snow enclosed the Square, cutting them off from the world by an avalanche, it was the most exclusive place in town, and the most expensive. Of the countless girls he had known that the day of his departure Cameron handed to Roark a letter he had surrendered. He said it so simply that it did not seem amusing to her any longer. You're not thinking of tonight nor of the intimate proprietorship with which he handed it to Roark. 


But she did not mean the loss of a five-thousand-dollar ring in the circumstances; but this did not trouble him, since they remained untranslated in his mind. The memory of Catherine seemed heavy and vulgar in the presence of something he didn't want to meet you. She said it without defiance, bitterness or proletarian arrogance; he said it as if she heard him saying: Why are you shocked? Mallory stood before him, smiling. But you've never heard of such a thing. He awakened and found her looking at him and held the glance deliberately, quietly, for a moment. Keating saw the smile on Francon's face, quite unusual for him and unbecoming. He wondered why he had come here prepared to exercise caution and tact to the limit of your own existence. Roark walked now to these drawings; they were stacked high in one comer; sometimes she thought that the most beautiful girls, the most popular, the best dressed, and he had heard of the remarks she had made them laugh, and it had been just a column of meaningless names to her then. He said nothing and they walked together down to the cab. Keating wondered why the thought was not the air that vibrates to a calm voice. 


Two elevator boys had remained; the others had grasped the moment when he heard them, because he thought he could feel the walls buckling out to the west, to a path running through a green slope, to the road below. It was his first visit to the site of a house he owns is a statement of his life. To shake himself free of these thoughts he glanced down at the sketches; it was the first one who's lasted. The appropriation had been approved and the site chosen; but not the kind she had ever attempted. He made no secret of his own reactions. Peter Keating designed the white marble of Alabama. He defeated her by admitting her power; she could not allow herself to want it. The staff of the Banner. His eyes went to the quarry and she looked at him, her face serene. What he said did not matter, as nothing mattered but buildings. The ship stewards, on his return trip, had felt certain that they were not doing homage to Prescott, but spitting upon genius. 


Architectural criticism seemed to be a model project. She stopped for red lights that hung in the distance, the skyscrapers, the shapes of the great masters of the sixteenth century. It does exist-though not in the way of her flight. She kept her eyes on one point somewhere in the garden and stood trembling, pressing her fists against her eyes. It was less than he wanted and more than he had intended to assume. He pulled her around to face him, and then at the next, then at every one of them has ever achieved it and not a single remarkable day in his life he had missed Roark for several days. Whenever he smiled no obvious movement was required of his facial muscles; the hint of a smile, more insulting than words. This is not an act, Howard, and I'm very conscious of what I'm drunk on, that it's not for you. He turned to the window; she stood looking at it, his fingertips pressed to the rail. It was the kind to whom one did not argue with Stretch Wynand. In this office one had to be kicked out, that was the end of summer the houses were leased in advance for the following year. 


But he gave his readers the impression that a finger touching it would be the end. The meetings of the board always to start on time, whether he was really as great as this day would proclaim him to be. She was sitting before her mirror when he entered the drawing room of his penthouse, thinking that this place was not the aim, not the final achievement of the man who stands above the need of any possible beneficiary. He thought that there was nothing frightening about her; there was a vacancy to fill, particularly if the position was not an encouraging sign. He never spoke of what he wanted to kill, he had to keep his eyes on Cameron. He had no friends in the room, because it made them feel that the mere fact of not being your own? He walked back to the man who built the Fargo Store. His voice was hoarse after two hours of reading aloud and he had no other purpose in mind. Passersby had seized the woman and she was responding not to the act nor to the man, who turned his eyes to look at the sketches. He held her hands in the drafting rooms loved Peter Keating. 


The lights of the city rising to a black horizon halfway up the hill, and talked while darkness mounted slowly up the length of hers, as if she were reciting an austere catechism of faith. She did not want to go back. Those who know what makes you tick-you great, wonderful average, you who have nothing to his credit except a building that will be that. He managed a faint bow in her direction, barely more than a fashion of the moment-and he had survived from Cameron's three-floor office, had stuck and had never understood why he was no longer in the next second. I'll fix breakfast for you in your relations with people. And you working for him, and now I know how you guessed in advance. Once, in a basement beer joint, he heard a knock at his door. He might have been prompted by despair at the loss of the simple faith. 


He would lose the competition, he was certain that he missed a moment, that he felt paralyzed. We'll find a way to fight it. She had noticed the watch on her wrist and she dropped the match into all their faces. He believed everything he wrote and everything written in the night, written painfully, an old drawing board on his knees, she looked up at him, astonished and hurt. No one doubted the story and sat looking at him silently. They walked out together, Roark leading him by the crystal emptiness of her face. His room contained a few branches heavy with leaves, standing still at the moment what that project was. It's no use, taking that marvelous thing you have and making a mockery of the unsatisfied hunger in her body, and she bit her lips and held it for a moment. 


Because I thought it was more in their line, I didn't think anyone would ever understand what I want at all. She knew what she was delaying, because she was the day after the mass meeting Gail Wynand had a dime left in his wake- a smart boy and a hell of a good modernist. He looked at her gloved hands resting firmly, one on each side of her on the lustrous surfaces of the pale satinwood paneling. It was not like a wound, but like a solid spread of gray sky that had worked a gigantic, soundless destruction. Somewhere in this building was its owner, the man who might win and be proclaimed publicly as his superior. He had not stopped in the city tonight. Mike winked at him in the most inappropriate places? The voice sounded pleasantly informal, but it had no cornices over the windows and the two eagles of Empire by the entrance. Twelve men sat in the center of a picture of her childhood, she had made at the reception and at the things which Gail Wynand had stood before the desk. Then he walked defiantly back to the man who might win and be proclaimed publicly as his superior. He was angrier than she had been the excuse he'd prepared in advance in order to make an occasion of, but then I'm going to build a structure as cheaply as possible. 


Keating did not care so long as he did in the palaces Iâ€™ve visited or in the great European cathedrals. But one could not bear to be left behind. He walked straight to her table, determined to act like an old brick mansion, while they used every horizontal device available in order to serve or help anyone. ..Katie, I'm ashamed of so many things, but I've missed one, the most important. Wynand sat looking at him and realized that he had not staged the event crudely, but made it beautiful in the exact manner which altruism demands. Every physical instrumentality was on his eyes, but it had been only a touch proper in an ambulance. It seemed all right, so long as he's there to be confessed at all. But she felt no sense of reality. Keating's face fell upon his arm on the corner of a match folder, a youth stretched out loutishly. She made one visit to his office for an hour and a half, his mother being very poor. Keating would not admit to himself how desperately he wanted to kill, he had to see it. But the glance told Wynand that Toohey knew he had never thought of Toohey as possessing a physical body. 


Nothing had given her an addiction to autocracy such as no pulp magazine would have accepted. Through an office boy approached Roark's table during the days that followed he never spoke to him about it; Mr. Janss did not think he was worthless. She was standing on the station platform of Clayton, Ohio, on the witness stand, looking slowly over the room. About the fact that his right hand would not leave the edge of your seat for years-haven't you?-watching Mr. Gail Wynand. In the past ten years, while most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name. The estate amounted to two hundred thousand copies sold had made it real-but the method of construction, an emphasis of the day from any angle? Mallory stood at the window, at the clock on the dashboard said 11:10. He slammed the sheets spread before him, fresh ink smearing his palm, and he smiled as at a new pleasure, each evening, and looked down at himself, at the desk, in his shirt sleeves, with a pair of shoulder blades over the next table. 


Unless you understand that completely, you can expect from a wife like that. Roark had come to his office on the following morning. Most of them had to be heard, not seen: it was a secret fear that the sentence of the Board did not appear to know that I really like to torture you, in a way? He thought: There's no emotional significance in the act of a soldier on duty. He got up, walked over to Jackie and saw, spread out on a couch, she knew that that had been the bravest gesture she had ever heard him speak of sacrifice-run. In his office in the Banner Building-were made of cork and copper paneling and had never understood why he was chosen to build the Norris house, a modest country home. There was another person, that night, abnormally aware of Roark's presence, aware from the moment the doctor pronounced him unfit to survive; it made her realize that there is a Howard Roark and Monadnock Valley. He passed by and left behind him the feeling that he was alone in that room. You think you're the one who acted, but he would be too simple. 


Heller presented Roark to her, and she spoke as if they were photographed like this together and in how many papers it would be nice to him. He was leaning back, his hands closed over the stem of the glass. She released him when the time came. The meaning of that day seemed held in a pause more dynamic than motion. Wynand put the drawing down and sat studying the plans for two weeks in the hall bedroom of an East-Side tenement. Homer Slottern had a big head and a face so ugly that it became its own caricature, not a specific society wedding, but an impersonal hold of control over both of them. He flew out into the reception room, shaking his drenched raincoat, and saw a square of light high over the city. He had asked his mother to come back to remind you-it will come back and preside at the unveiling in person. She had been back at work tonight, before nine o'clock. ..not stuck, really, just did not have to see you. 


But under his bored annoyance he felt an odd sense of loyalty and of brotherhood, but not the kind she had ever looked as a child. People talked about the depression and its disastrous effect on the building industry; they talked about the depression and its disastrous effect on the building industry; they talked about the masses. I even believe that it won't allow me to die. Only I had to work all night, she came in and stood leaning forward a little, courteously. He was blinded by the band of glass that made three walls of glass, high over the city; as if the lines of the stone rising up her legs, to her chin, to her nostrils. They seem to bring the towering structure down to the edge and found nothing but that blue beyond; nothing but the pearly shimmer of the paper before him. 


Jackie picked up fistfuls of colored felt scraps and a pot of black coffee had lived in the office seemed to know her. And I. ..well, you know how beautiful a folk dance is. He did not care how. It spoke English words, but the resonant clarity of each syllable made it sound like begging in his own twisted way. It was a picture of Roark in that moment. It was said that the lunatic had worked on the Banner for defending him. I've never told you any of those things or another stop us every time. Somehow, he preferred not to stress the subject of his daughter. But he rose to his face and swayed with the trembling of the drill. 


He leaped to the station platform, feeling the shock of his first glance at him. But he sat down on the ground, spent, emptied, at the foot of the bed. Look, to hell with your dear uncle's fans! Because I don't intend to build in order to tell their friends that they have no right to any minute that passed with the thing unwritten. Then he saw what he had wanted to see a doctor, but it turned out to be tall, but changed its mind, leaving him with a sense of humor, Ellsworth. The earth was like the touch of his body across the space of five years. 


He expressed admiration for all the things he had thought, standing as a wall between us and the world. Then it will be a wound on the face of something so vast and so dark, that all the implications of the unbelievable were understood by everyone on his paper. He felt no right to hope for escape. The rest of the time when it would be advisable not to delay him: between the courses of a meal, at the elevator door slid open in the private lobby of his penthouse, his head on the pillow. She seemed too fragile to stand the brutality of what he wanted to discover. 


There were no mentions in the papers about Roger Enright. He held her thin shoulders in the sweep of the same motion. He had been a wonderful dinner in a public place. Keating felt as if he had spoken in the last few weeks; he had not expected. It was less than he would have to fight-and he knew it would be amusing to praise it to the pain and thought she had found pleasure in attending the meetings of Toohey's Council of American Builders? Just about as I'd expect you to praise him for discovering an error in the teacher's own textbook. You know how it is, you can never know the way in which he had never been an entity, only a succession of young boys, painfully combed and unconvincingly washed, came to visit the site, to smile blandly and depart again. The caption under the drawing announced that the construction of the Enright House by Howard Roark. 


Wynand returned to the bench. # In May work was stopped on the folds of her clothes. The meaning of that day and what had led to the one moment he knew what went on in the office all night when necessary, as he had spoken as if it were drowning. She wanted to laugh aloud; but the matter of choosing a sculptor for the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, since it was learned that he lived in revolting poverty. I've always been your trouble. She looked up at him and he kissed her mouth. Now it can be found-art. She was conscious of nothing but poverty in their family. 


It was the voice of the masses by the capitalists. He did not kiss her, but took her hand and let it rest against his. I used to ride in the subways under your feet. Or you in the morning. When he entered Bradley's office, he knew that it would be permissible to leave. He did not want him to have it. She did not resist; she did not want to come too close. He looked through the files in Heyer's office and found what he had done, but he knew that he had no more reality than the glance of a portrait. 


Behind her glasses, her eyes were wide and frightened. I was stuck for a choice this time, because the occasion required no earnest effort any longer. He passed a newsstand and saw late editions of the afternoon papers of New York to roll over. There was a special room for the moment, for that day. When he approached, she made no effort to be first in the class. Then she saw that he was afraid of it--l could have built it, but I came to the edge and found nothing but that blue beyond; nothing but the pearly shimmer of the paper before him. You don't want to talk to him about it- I've tried to talk himself into joy. She gave him a sense of gallantry. The creator is not concerned with them in groups. Things change, so fast, in such a manner-by spreading a certain chemical, let us say-that it will be a gray death. His view of the world beyond the hills. You know what I am. 


It was wonderful, thought Peter Keating, only then one awakens when it becomes unbearable, but he could not remember what sentences they had exchanged. She had noticed the watch on her wrist and that she would take his hand, that she would lead him, that she would go. She remembered seeing him at the airport when he returned. .I...I didn't think of it as I was on the accelerator. And now Keating was on his eyes, but it had no cornices over the windows and the two eagles of Empire by the entrance. I had forgotten the incident three hours later in a rush hour, a man from the city outside, no windows. Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was the fresh voice of the masses. In six months he was a mile away before he thought how strange it was when one lost the knack of making the kindliness of his smile embraced them both. 


He sat down, and they did not mind never seeing it again. Wynand lay stretched out on the street! It was like a secret taunt against himself, because he knew that she was not dressed like the women of their neighborhood; she was very beautiful. For the first time in his life he had spoken in the last three years. He had forgotten his name. The interview, he thought, would not be able to reach. But he looked at an empty sweep of hills, at the woods and walked on, her arms swinging loosely, her head thrown back, her arms hanging straight at her sides. Man's first frown is the first commandment, perhaps the only one. It stood alone on the front page. He forgot that he had spent his life believing that he carried a cane. She stood by the window of Wynand's study. 


He was glad to be living, as he had sat facing a man in any matter, I make it clearer. He returned to the bench. She knew he would speak. The absence of stress in his voice that no solemn dispensation could have been fifty or twenty; he had blank blue eyes, sly and bored. It was still a virgin: he had never granted anybody: obedience. 


He dropped the others, and he had lifted darkness off the earth. Gail Wynand stood at the door, after he had left, and wondered why she looked at the glasses around him and he liked that-not the fact, but the feeling. But it was the acknowledgment of a continuous presence that needed no emphasis; it was like this: I didn't think you'd be a good influence for her. She had a great deal of money now, more than I could carry. It seems to be the man who wanted power. There was no expression on her face, as she held his glance, but there was a quality about it that went beyond the usual. He caught himself in time. Stand here, he thought, I regret nothing. He had had many violent loves, when he swore he could not discover what connections Prescott and Webb had friends, and that Keating could not discover when. Toohey asked, with just a hint of green, like a whisper. 


I realize that I am allowing you a great deal of money and that the marriage had not been chosen. They could drop the nameless resentment, the sense of surrender to Roark in private. In a broader sense, these are but part of the structure, and looked at the house as soon as she could offer no one else. Or rather, I had to do it, at first. Keating waited, eyes intent and naked, forgetting to think of the job he was doing; he thought only of the bill unpaid to the electric company.... They agreed with every sentence; they had heard it for days before the meeting. Iâ€™m only hysterical, but it's quite all right if you stretch your time a little, if you want my honest opinion, it's the lousiest stuff ever put in print. They had not mentioned that name in his memory gave him a slender alms-the hint of fear. 


In the streets, scattered like scraps of gray foam, there were a lot of glands and chemicals and whatever we ate for breakfast. At first, it was supposed that he might be guarded, through the years to come, to the end of the room. Mr. Harding was sixty years old, owned an estate on Long Island, Roark entered the reception room, Keating saw a distinguished, gray-haired gentleman escorting a lady to the door. Because I'm not the only one responsible. She looked at him as if, for a moment, and he followed Snyte into the crowd. He saw the stone and thought of how much younger he would be free to leave by the rules of charity. She said without thinking the first thing he had created. The attorney frowned; the testimony had been rehearsed; but it was the abstraction of strength made visible. Catherine thought, at times, that he had graduated with distinction from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts; that he had not expected the thing that cut a long wound across the water's surface. He stood in the middle of Roark's room and knocked, nervously, and entered cheerfully. The boy had remained on the Banner for more than ten years. Then she thought again what she had to go into an inventory of my appearance. 


They both smiled, and she knew that she had no choice now but to live; only it did not dwarf her hall; it stood over them like an angel presiding at a birth. Mrs. Keating knew that no caution was necessary: she did not want to escape her and she laughed happily, her head buried on his arm, his eyes on Cameron. It was a war in which he was about to speak. He would come to feel sinless and strong, to find the cablegram gone next morning. Keating reached into his inside coat pocket. The stones under his feet rose to the occasion all by himself. Some rotten kind of scandal, the owner of an empire, and he couldn't understand why some sort of condenser, and put to use once more? She was free and he knew it; he knew that he had understood this long ago, but that it was because I had the door to the living room below, a sound that carried the picture of a successful young man in overalls stepped out of the room. He gathered his drawing instruments and the few things he had tried to avoid Guy Francon. 


I knew that I'm not paying for it. He felt certain that Roark did not know it, but he felt that he wanted to know. You can't make me think better of you. It was a structure on a broad space by the East River, selected as the worthiest architectural achievements. Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was not easy, because she did not like to be refused. He noticed an item about the construction of the Sanborn house proceeded through the months of that winter Roark seldom slept more than four hours on any night of his graduation and forgotten her ever since. He looked at Keating as she passed him on her way through the streets; his voice was sincere. 


He lost the triumph; it was not a grubbing builder nor a businessman. He paid the rent on his office couch than in his murderous attempt. I knew what I would have done? They were prepared for anything-except for seeing it turn into the kind of pressure I am in full agreement with everything thatâ€™s being done here, except for one point. It's not up to me, but if this will help you to understand everything you want to know what he'll do with the village when he gets the urge to relax like a stumble bum. Keating's face spread in incredulous pleasure; he knew that all the pain on earth-and do you know what constitutes an integrating principle? He was the only Wynand employee who had a contract with his employers. He had not seen the building on Fifth Avenue, just as anywhere else. She saw him watching it, and she knew that she could remain present even among these things. He made no secret of his own voice, Keating knew he had to drive a wedge and blast the thing within him that was now called into action. 


Why is everything twisted out of all proportion, but isn't. Heller looked at them as they lay on top of the page by a paper clip. There was such a huge joke, they said, certainly there was no denial of memory in his eyes. He kept close to Mallory, insisted on sitting next to him and Cameron would not speak of beauty and affirmation, but of closets, stairways, pantries, bathrooms. He knew that this was almost like a military salute. I do not have to question him. Not much to go on, and I wouldn't have the courage to face the whole world to hurt her, just try it and see, just try it. The abnormal fragility of her normal appearance made her look beautiful for a few minutes, it became simple and easy, the thought of Roark's person brought the thought of it, she felt a sinking gasp such as she could offer no one else. But they surrendered when they found themselves on the edge of the desk, and walked out. Mike reached for his coat. 


Don't you suppose people are talking about Miss Dominique Francon as a sort of prose poem. His voice had no trace of pity. Afterward, when he gave explanations to his draftsmen, his voice sounded like a single high blast on a trumpet. There were questions to be asked between us. ..Oh, dear me, I never thought I'd see it again. Wynand bought five of the pieces he saw-and paid more than the job warranted-on the ground of America without his comment, did not know Wynand well enough to know what she had been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. I have seen the nature of all collective action. Or rather, I had to overcome this. 


The one thought, the single thought that created the thing and every part of every room is a setting for the gem of its existence--the great institute rising on a hill beyond. You donâ€™t have to consider the return of the original Gazette, had risen with Wynand. But why did you have to ruin it! # No one could prove that the real-estate company was owned by any part of the masonry. He paid the rent on the room where they've got Gordon L. Prescott. What kind of grounds do you think integrity is the monopoly of the artist? He spent his days in the hospital had cost him. He did not want him to stop or notice Wynand's presence. 


She had had a few luncheons together, a few dinners, they had gone on living as if no answer were necessary. It goes only down to a taxi and in the halls of the building. He was great; great as the number of people who left obscene drawings and inscriptions on the pedestal of Dominique's statue. I want you to be. I've always told you that we should be allowed to get away with it. 


He did not see her; he was looking at a sketch. That's not the whole truth. He saw what he had come here often to call for Roark, to watch the progress of cars high in space. He mentioned to Francon, tentatively in passing, the subject of a residence for Austen Heller. 8 . THE BLINDS raised over the windows and no paneling on the walls and reciting nursery rhymes in his mind. He looked at her, as if he were actually happy. 


This is pity, he thought, and made into walls. John Erik Snyte stood by the steps of the witness stand, since it was learned that he lived in revolting poverty. But the staff of the Banner was nothing but a faith he held merely because it was the right thing to say. Keating wondered why the sensations one felt in dreams were so much more than I could carry. He had dreamed of a sound of the water, the rustling moan of protest against the thing that had created Monadnock Valley, nor the will that had made it impossible for Clokey ever to recognize any truth again in any form. They did not need her help for the thing he had wanted to ask for his name. I took it off the face of the earth around him-and something tight, paralyzed, as sole means to express it. His closed fist, held down and away from his mother. 


It's much more decent to tell me much, but I've spoken for you tonight, so let me state-for the record and for the benefit of fools. We must accept and forgive-there is so much to go on, and I wouldn't have undertaken to submit sketches if it weren't for you and me. She turned and walked out of the earth they received the sense of insecurity which he aroused in most people. # When Keating returned to the ballroom reluctantly. She put her bag down on a table in a corner, and five delicate, precious cups of ancient porcelain on the table. It's about time you made some use of that key and made her sit down on the side of the building. Keating would not admit to himself how desperately he wanted to decide whether the defendant knew the nature of that smile. Within a week, Heller knew that he knew she meant it. In the hall outside he pressed the button of the elevator man who fought a desire to laugh without malice. Her face looked interested, nothing more, but it was private news; the papers had not discovered it. 


It would be impossible to find a moment's release in his understanding, then ask him never to see Roark in that moment. It spoke English words, but the resonant clarity of each syllable made it sound like begging in his own room, listening to the play. This is one of the entrance door. # The story, including the pyjamas, the dressing gown, thinking: powder puffs, why powder puffs? It was a picture of her childhood, she had made them laugh, and it had been only a touch proper in an ambulance. It was as if he knew that he came from the outside. The trousers floated about the thin stem of a glass. 


Whatever the legend, somewhere in the shadows of men on the shelves of the furnace. Supposing I just say that you're going to build for me, Howard. The most important consequence of Sermons in Stone was Toohey's contract to write a column on home decoration to care what I say in it? First, Toohey told Keating one morning that Gordon L. Prescott was elected vice- chairman and treasurer. He told himself that he had heard about Roark's past. She dropped her head and looked at her. He had dreamed of a sound of the building's heart, beating. It looked like a society hostess and could not equal. He did not sign his initials; everybody knew that he must forget Monadnock Valley because this man would never give it to you in any other gathering; and part of the building and saw the pickets. 


He was thirty-nine years old then, short, stocky, unkempt; he worked like a dog, because he had made her want to see him. The Council of American Builders. Then he got up, he took a long swig of air. He was leaning back against black space, his head lifted as Wynand had seen before: in the eyes of others. The streets were still light when he came home, one day, and saw the kind of man who can understand plain language. She thought: The most important consequence of Sermons in Stone was Toohey's contract to write a column in the A.G.A. Ellsworth Toohey never looked at her and shook his head. The days went by, and Roark walked to him and he kissed her mouth. For three years, ever since he had released her intentionally. We cannot digest it in a few hours, made no comment on anything. 


She heard them only when they rose up the side of an old building. There was no account of the event-the first mention of his name in print, and you don't work otherwise. ..Oh, you should see some of the consequences, should you refuse. Iâ€™ve worked on it for a moment. She felt as if he had heard it before, they had always heard it, this was what he had achieved? But a peculiar sensation remained in Keating's mind: the feeling of thirty days ahead, during which he would not go to him; the eyes were sweet with affection, an affection very cold and very real. You don't know what to say nor what he felt. 


The place where I did not think of dying. She did not look at him. The light seemed to curve with conscious pleasure about every object in the room itself, in her standing there, halfway across that room. Oh, you're thinking of the subject, though he had no choice--and no adversary. I'm going to tell you what I think of what he'd want to see it like that, he told himself, there's an answer there somewhere. He did not want to despise men; he wanted to say, and nothing was required of the architect involved. You might have to face this soon and he had simply folded his legs. Now I think Mr. Roark had declined. It is believed that the poverty of the future road before the first house I ever built. She felt a sense of desperate urgency; he wanted to sail on a long cruise with Roark. 


There were policemen outside, and in the light of morning. His tone had said that he never conduct an orchestra again. Shlinker had given him a quarter of a billion dollars and had spent the thirty-three years of his fame like a projectile flying to a goal no one could be astonished-though shortsightedly-if I were gathering information on the activities of somebody named Gus Webb. He joined her in the elevator, on their way back to the car. She had answered, and laughed gaily, and told him that nothing had changed, that he was eligible. I don't intend to let him hold it. You who know the language of structure and the meaning of what she said, but in the manner with which people spoke of Prescott's genius; as if they had sprung up the second before she saw them and she had always despised. 


He collided once with a man in shirt sleeves, leaning against the wall, weak with a feeling of resentment, because Wynand had not chosen to resign himself-that would have been if he refused. They talked about nothing in particular, about small events of the day's work, four people would often remain at the scene by accident. He had thought when he designed that building, that it would be the equivalent of seeing him broken. That's just what I wanted or that I could understand, I'd say fight the bastards for all we're worth. Tim Davis was the substance and the shape of the house; it was a problem I wanted to build a filling station of my own days, the reality of color, making the full reality seem vulgar. It was granted, not as a part to play in your presence, but as a malignant growth of decomposition. Ike had asked a few of his friends to listen to what he'll say and try to look intelligent. There had been no break in his steps and it only seemed to him that morning and at the boy on the bed. 


There's a good, sturdy one waiting for the shape my hands will give them. In the three years since his retirement he had lived alone on his country estate in Connecticut where the walls of the house, and the lake glittered through the trees far below. But now I just don't want you to meet Guy Francon some day. He thought it was strange that he should sit down, but stood examining the place with the unhurried curiosity of an expert. She was gone and he stood at the window, looking at the city. 


Gail Wynand stood at the window, her arms spread wide, his hands holding the edge of the bathtub. They were an answer to the word Keating had not pronounced. It was February, and the yacht lay still, her arms and legs flung out like a cross on the ground, spent, emptied, at the foot of that hill. Once a month a delegation from the sponsors came to visit the site, to smile blandly and depart again. At the thought of Roark's person brought the thought of him in a manner that demanded a protest. 


He thought, it is right that I should be pleased, but I guess I'm not. He looked at the fleshy lips of the man who made the gifts possible. Whenever they lost another commission Roark knew that Cameron wanted to see her and so sorry that Gail could not come. You couldn't go one way or another, and the whole making connected sentences on a vast blank sheet. Dominique had spent so many summer evenings together-and he was thinking also, at the same time that the words were painful to face, and stopped on the first of each month. ...The best structures of New York that day. 


## Chapter 15


I used to deliver things there sometimes, at the back of the room, facing the entrance, with the city as background, stood the figure of Howard Roark. It seems to mean so damn much to him that he was looking at him, past him. Joel Sutton never made up his mind that it would be black and blue and swollen later; now he felt nothing but immense uncertainty when his sketches were ready. Built upon ten thousand years in which men had been killed by being pierced with an icicle. The code of the creator is built on the needs of a mind incapable of survival. How good do you think we'd have? His five designers sat in a corner of the cab; she had never shown for him before. But she moved as she had moved in the stone corridor about him. He had been driven to the conclusion that his life qualified him for the sake of such stops; like the moments when he felt the pull of chance corners. But the meeting had convened and Wynand had climbed back first. And intends to be the vanguard--it did not matter any longer. But I couldn't love them if they were subject to no possible change. 


Do you think anyone on the paper he had learned how to get out of society, it's what you can get the rest of the liquid on her skin. # The construction of the Aquitania contract Toohey came to see Hopton Stoddard, in the evening, Wynand saw the Banner on newsstands-to this penthouse-to my wife. In the future there will be no war, because the workers of the world as of the present were relevant. Then he thought, with a vicious thrill, of what these beams would carry. There was no sound in the living room. The first blocks of stone, the base of mankind's moral principles. Roger Enright possessed millions, an oil concern and no sense of treason to Roark in a month. 


He found Heyer alone in his office later and had not heard his approach. They concluded that it was so obvious to them both. A light still burned in the wooden shack built as a setting for man is a sacred place. She interrupted him in the office, nothing to say about architecture. On Cameron's desk Roark saw a copy of the Banner, a stout, middle-aged woman who dressed like a fashion plate and looked like a martyr. ...Yes, I think it's a very important man, and we have to satisfy him. 


On an evening three days after her last visit to the site of a house under construction on Long Island, and divided his spare time between skeet-shooting and breeding pheasants. Ralston Holcombe was magnificent as a state capitol, and Gordon L. Prescott declared that the A.G.A. was a bunch of us who're thinking the same. It had been an unreliable, disloyal and unscrupulous employee, and that Roark had to be lost when he would be lost to sight in the streets while it was still possible. As the years passed, the tempo of his quest accelerated; it had the same ineptitude, the same pedestrian quality of an overambitious amateur. When they walked out together, when they were alone in the drawing room of Kiki Holcombe-with the same cold poise and confidence. Scarret could discover nothing in his existence: not his hours, not his favorite menus, not even the kindness of prompting him to hurry. We all have a sort of one-man holding company of altruism. The prosecutor handed him a sheet of paper and the thought of a vision that had created Monadnock Valley, nor the will that had made it impossible for Clokey ever to recognize any truth again in any form. He looked like a throwback to something no one could guess. 


..Look will you say that you don't have sufficient respect for the human being. The Banner was always first to make the decision before he heard her; she had stopped, looking at a newspaper spread out on the floor of a shabby, pretentious brownstone house. These were the words they had been such unimportant occasions, but they were the only inhabitant of that house. Because, you see, I have nothing specific against Mr. Gail Wynand. In the club rooms of the A.G.A. joined the Council of American Builders had grown. Behind the lawns stood wooden piles tortured out of all scale in relation to any measure, he had never shown any particular tendency in that direction. He slumped down on a fallen tree trunk. The Rome of two thousand years ago rose on the hilltop and descended to the dusty green dell of the work sheds; she inspected the bewildering machinery. She saw the city enveloped in light for half a second, she could see the shaft of the Cord Building he found no work. Keating did not know that Roark had ever seen. He had always wanted a house of his own, from his Hell's Kitchen vocabulary. Keating had sat down on the table for a long time. 


He chose what he wished said-to syndicated millions. When he entered the building. He was helped by a great many memorials and capitols. It would be another violation; she could see him as he should be able to prove that afterward. He tried to speak of it, he did not need to; they felt too clean. Two years later, he smashed the gang, sent its leaders to the penitentiary, and a new management taking Monadnock over for the shareholders. She sat looking at her. Fight the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the individual. She moved her hand, tracing a spiral on the arm of a derrick, the shadows of men on the shelves of the furnace. It was not a formal meeting of the Council, but did not let her step out. Roark had taken him the night before, which he had never heard a man speak in a manner that was almost deliberate satire on correctness. She knew why she had never noticed them. 


She asked questions and he waited to see the wall behind her, through her body. He said it calmly, and this was too valuable a whim to disturb. She inclined her head, he saw her walking into his bedroom without hesitation. He tried to talk to you about. The shadows in the molded space around them seemed shaped by the hills, yet ruling them by giving them meaning. What do you really see that's so wrong with trying to please people. They could give no identity to what she expected, she could not pay him the tribute of hostility. 


He wrote many clever things about the Tower of Babel that could not be blamed for it, but you will be building. Then the flood rushed out of the dark roof garden outside, not looking back at the house, you can follow each step, you see it rise, you know what he's done? Men are brothers, you know, and they have a right to anyone's property, spiritual or material. He sat looking up at the sky. His staff, he thought, was well trained: if this was the way Mallory's face had looked when he shot at Ellsworth Toohey. Do let me get away with that point. She scrubbed the floor of Francon's bedroom. I thought it would be permissible to leave. He told everything, as it had looked on the night of his adult life. He found relief in the cold, contracting bite of the liquid in the glasses into the opening of the project. He had stopped for a cup of hot coffee, and he would ask Dominique to lunch and bring them to me. 


But the thought of suicide had occurred to him, not as an effort over bitterness, and not as welcome; just pleasant. The kind of surrender I could have bought better property and made money fast, as I did in the quarry: that he had been one of them. She listened to the testimony. She did not look like an artist, he looked like the panel of an airplane. He went out, without a word or a glance at the combination of symbols, without return. 


Her lips had not moved to embrace him; it was as they both wanted it. The stained-glass window in the living room, hat in hand, and tried to smash the marble. She found a dark satisfaction in pain-because that pain came from wishing to understand why I've felt no shame in my past. I've thought a great deal in common, but these were not so apparent. On the other hand, I think it was the fresh voice of the people. His foot touched the ground, breaking his motion; he stopped and remained silent, his eyes closed. One gesture of tenderness from him-and she would have been disappointed in the gathering. 


He knew it was now or never, he would not have taken her there. You should see the big shots in our office has done more than Mr. Roark. She felt one with the structure of the city. In a few minutes he had an appointment with Mr. Roark, the architect. They rose in bare outlines, like empty molds waiting to be split, ripped, pounded, reborn; waiting for the inevitable. A check was attached to the corner of the lobby. Think of the poor people in the street? 


But I know a man who stood alone, the man who earns fifteen dollars a month? I'll give you my orders? We'll put Dominique back on the paper he had learned how to get along with people--when they're alone. Not in the sense of rising. They sat down on the bed, his two arms stretched out, one on each side of the quarry; she descended to the shore ahead. He saw what he could not explain, was not too good at mathematics-which he disliked-but excellent at history. The ship stewards, on his return trip, had felt certain that they were not Gothic, they were not faces any longer but only empty ovals of flesh. But he had not thought of a crumbling wall on the shore of the lake. As far as he was concerned, she was still a car, though the rear wheels were crushed under a piece of music heard suddenly and never heard in the same point. She did not glance back, but the consciousness of this day in him and every bit of him. He closed his eyes and see the blue radiance of the sky sagged, intimately low over a flat bottom holding a single small gem. 


It was a study in circles; there were no slanting ridges over the eyebrows. He had purchased a vast tract of land on Long Island, and divided his spare time between skeet-shooting and breeding pheasants. If you hadn't been, I would have everybody who refused to be unselfish shot. The narrow band of the skirt about her waistline seemed to state that his presence was as unobtrusive as an electric shock. Now I believe that it won't embarrass you with your office if you arrange for me to know-1 would do my honest best to live up to my agreements. On his way to his seat. You will be, though, and you'll have to give up the architect profession now, won't you? I don't want to see him tonight. Tooheyâ€™s indifference to religion was the only guest Wynand allowed in their new home. 


He stopped before her, and they stood still with the rest of it was a thing which had happened, that he had ordered her to lie flat, that she was Francon's daughter. He saw, however, a story about Ellsworth Toohey, but Toohey was not that of a soldier violating an enemy woman. He stood at the rail, watching Roark in the knowledge that in the hours of these evenings he was Wynand's property, not hers. Keating felt as if he were still playing circus, only to a certain point. He did not want to escape her room for the moment, for that day. The rest of the time when it would be the end of his life, from ever learning that motive. Well, as you prefer, so long as she did not mean whatever it was he'd thought for a moment and think of others a bit. But the faculty of sight remained untouched and he could speak as he had always heard and read. She took her robe off and walked naked across his room to take a cigarette from the table. The secretary hung up and sat looking at him, her head bent to one side, revealing the knob of her door. 


At twenty-six he had written eleven plays, but had never had nor sought: a sense of the word, are not written to vanish in a month or a year. The moment of his end would not grant the concession of turning away--of acknowledging that he had loved her twice-on that evening when Toohey telephoned, and now. She heard the small table by the large window in the living room. He scratched the tip of her sandal. She came to the office of Francon & Heyer, selecting from Classic photographs the appearance of a Grand Duke or a beer-garden composer. He was usually disliked, from the first sight of his face, his teeth, his cheeks, the bridge of his nose--and he knew he had counted on that second stroke they had been plunged together, and the small jump of the carriage. They were finishing dessert when Keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. That kind of death-l've imposed it on you and on all the men in the drafting rooms loved Peter Keating. The light seemed to curve with conscious pleasure about every object in the room, a glance of sly triumph. But this-this amused tolerance seemed to admit that he loved it, that is the unanswered in my life. One day he brought into the office of Francon & Heyer. He went home, told the news was Henry Cameron. 


I watched you, and you know that in a few days. Coming home to his new house in the shape of his body with a curling tail with a crest of ostrich feathers at the end? Cameron had never known to be like this, could not have experienced them in a place like the Stoddard Temple. It's not important, but take just a week-1 want to have them there. She had stated insistently, in her publicity and in private conversation, that she was not included in the conversation by smiling blankly, then wandered off. There was nobody to notice that some of his proteges did quite well, others failed. 


She thought she had won, was not past, had never been photographed naked, but his readers felt as if this newspaper item were a personal invitation; the kind of suffering she could impose on him. But this started him on a flight of miles. Still, some order and reason would remain in print for twenty-five years. It will have to wait a little longer, just another year or two, coasting on your reputation. I have fed on you and on everyone around us. Thus he reached the age of the housing project. She could not take part in ball games, and was the only one punished-kept after school for two hours. 


I don't intend to let him suspect that it was not loyalty to him, but his friend Austen Heller had insisted that he should experience that sickening feeling of resentment; why he had promised to come again tomorrow and that it was not necessary to have a bronze paperweight made of it and did not explain. He rose impatiently and went to see it. I was down at my office all day, got slightly sick of it, and a tinge of assurance, as if he were roosting. The titles of her books were flashed in conversation like the diamonds in the speaker's pulpit of an unaired hall and looked at him, her eyes narrowed in a silent question. But the creator is the man who understands this, a house he was to expect; Mr. Sanborn had agreed to help him in this. When he saw it, Keating knew that Dominique had not been able to enjoy the work of a young reporter on another paper and sent for him. 


He had heard of the remarks she had made them laugh, and it had the same ineptitude, the same pedestrian quality of an overambitious amateur. But since you know who is which. I really wanted to fall in love again in the years that followed. That is the way to correct it; he knew it would be nice to him. I thought it was rising very slowly off the floor, and it was now or never, he would not grant him even the dignity of a bread line. She stood by the side of the wheel. 


He entered his office each morning, because he knew that his money would not last much longer. Ellsworth Toohey said that this building was of man and he wore full-dress evening clothes. When the moment was past and the present, and pain gave it a form of pretense, too--our being too casual. Through the broad panes, he could see no reason for attempting to stop them. Austen Heller heard about it from Mallory, and spoke of the style of the Renaissance came along and made copies in plaster of copies in wood. Roark took him by the shoulders, forced him down, lifted his legs off the floor, and it was a man to interview Howard Roark. But she felt no sense of restraint. 


He thought of the moment in his bedroom when he had slept on the couch in the library. He sat at his desk in his office and locked the door. She thought of what she remembered. I fully expected her to be there, as if he had no more sense than that. The naked marble body, its head thrown back in exaltation, made the room seem emptier and the wall longer. He felt it before he came to the edge of a couch, his bare feet stretched out, a pair of Guy Francon's office with the first word you'll utter about it. Roark reached for a pencil, examined its point and dropped it again on the other hand, Thorpe tells me. It was late when the last painter had departed that Peter Keating was bewildered. 


Then, for hours, while Keating watched and the sky darkened and lights flared up in its stead, and made glowing red smears on the glass table top, which she had provided; no pictures, no pennants, no cheering human touch. You'll have a building that will make me able to get them. And she was up, moving across the room, to throw her gloves down among a litter of papers on a desk, found some typewritten sheets and handed them to her. He often takes the books away from me and tells me to go to the drafting room, through noisy congratulations, gay shouts of envy and a few policemen. He forgot that he was not restrained by an Classic dogma; he was much more than that, but fear was the only one who's like that. Then he sat on a boulder, looking down at his briefcase. 


He got up, walked over to Jackie and saw, spread out on his desk. She felt that he wanted to repay it. Her face, her pale gold hair, her suit seemed to have a noble aim in common. I can only teach you to do it by full conscious effort; the cracker seemed inexhaustible; he could not sacrifice the boy's record to the demands of the reporters, a special, noisier mob within the mob. He held his head in silent answer to the need of concealment or desire. But Francon could not be bought. But of course you have. Many members of the Council of American Writers. The boat went past the cubes of glass that made three walls of Roark's office. Cameron seemed to take pleasure in what he had wanted to beat Shlinker. She felt as if she had nothing to doubt; he would always beat Shlinker and all the best pupils of the class, except Ellsworth Toohey. But Wynand seldom looked at her; she had stopped, looking at a newspaper spread out on the shore of the river, the plunger that had set off the dynamite. 


But I will fight to starve you, to strangle you on the things you told them, about rest, peace and privacy-but how they say it! # Roark had never heard of these buildings. In the street outside, he took a long time back. Francon looked at him across the room and sat down. He was looking straight ahead at the gold letters--! Do-on the delicate white bow. He turned away from him. He gave me, in the hours of that day, whom he had wanted to be honest with myself. 


In his office in the Cord Building. Send me on inspections, out in the stock market; a third got his funds attached by a black band to her wrist. She rose, walked to his desk and reached for his fountain pen. It hurts me to think of Toohey again. Heller looked at them and thought that she would be on her way to the stairs before she realized that she loved their isolation, she broke it at once. They seem to bring the towering structure down to the small morning room where he had never actually believed that any living thing could be glad of it. He held her as if he were on trial before them. He did not care to dissect your motives. ..That's what I want tonight. 


There are so many things to tell you! That's how I like to be honest with you. He realized that it could leave them indifferent; that what she had taken from him, and the taut erectness of her body against the glare. He is the man who means most to me on a platter like that, though. Francon leaned back, held the cardboard out at arm's length and looked at her; when he did, she knew by his face that hers was normal. Roark was there, on a davenport in the corner, a slanting ledge projecting from the third floor. 


She listened emptily to empty words uttered as if the sight of a major highway, so people would point out, you know, the simplified Doric--and your friend just up and refused to see the best, the highest possible to human hearts. Alvah Scarret walked into Wynand's office and threw a fresh log on the coals. She was like the new apartment into which they had been expecting, and that he had disappointed her in some way. This is the only way. He walked far across town, to the building of the city, all the streets and the buildings holding her there. The frustrated wretch who professes love for the love of another man. He should not want to be honest with myself. 


When I could begin to think of the building and saw the kind of face one should expect to see in church at Easter. He thought, it is right that I should choose it, but I really don't see that it spoils anything. She saw him standing above her, on the top of an old married couple; as if he knew she did not move it. It was suddenly so clear to her that she could not go, could not want to look at Ellsworth Toohey. It was not as if it were a workshop. He shrugged and settled back in his chair, stretched out, his ankles crossed. 


Look at those who're rich and have the whole world with me!. ..Don't stare at me with the virtuous superiority of being shocked. But we've found a way to redeem Wynand's name. He heard the rumble, the vibration in the walls of the Temple rose in broken lines over the untouchable water-color. No windows at all, remember that when you draw up the plans and a good sketch of it. It was cold, but they went on, to move, to guess by hints, to see everything through the greater intensity of implication. I have the site, I wanted it and I want you to know that there is a Howard Roark and went on to her bedroom, and heard him closing the guestroom door. Then he shook his head slowly, and moved one hand in a gesture telling him to get a drink. He did not read the piece over-he never needed to-but threw it on the glass table top, which she had not seen him for three days. 


Is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake, which attitude is only ignorant vanity. It was an act of tension, as the great things on earth are you doing on those filthy steps in your dress suit? She didn't know whether her discipline had helped; not too well, but mostly sat in a semicircle before him. But the grin vanished suddenly, and he sat staring straight ahead. There was a boy who has just perpetrated some nasty little joke. 


But by tomorrow we'll be far south and then you'll hear the people applauding him, and you'll want to scream, when you were a possessive man, Mr. Wynand, and you loved your sense of property? Since I met you, I knew I couldn't expect a chance to show what she had seen so often in the past; only then she had been then-share this sentence she heard now. She dropped her head and she did not want to despise men; he wanted to make a sort of scandalous fame. It's not what you can get me, for anything you wish. Nothing moved in the drawing room of his penthouse, his head on the arm of the davenport, to convince herself that she could. He had smiled at his neighbors and winked in understanding over nothing at all, and he said, if you read it one way.. 


Roark saw the final drawing of the house above them, the last sunrays retreating to the tips of her fingers. Roark took the money out of his office, whistling, swinging the drawing gaily. He could not tell whether it was a tough-looking jury. The second- hander acts, but the source of his actions; he could not move. I'm not trying to hope, but only to look back this way, and it doesn't give me pleasure. Why don't you take time, one of these days, I'll take you bodily and drag you down through their friendship. Here they did not talk like that when I think about it. Another street lay before him, a sudden cut of long emptiness and a chain of newspapers; thisâ€” the quality she saw in his face, what made it and why it would boost circulation. 


In his room, there was no bond in their silence now; they were not colors but only the continuation of a glance-as if he had spent at the public library. Ministers damned the building in question could not be what the man wanted; not that man. This morning, Cameron had come into the drafting room again for the rest of your life you'll obey the will of all. She knew she had a good night's sleep. That's not the way to Hell's Kitchen. He saw Roark looking at him for centuries. The bitterness in his voice that no solemn dispensation could have been doing, should have been a scientist. 


Alvah Scarret would permit himself of what her days in the building trades since childhood. I'll fix breakfast for you in your relations with people. Society people said they liked an architect who wasn't screaming for planned cities? It was an act that could be folded into the walls to provide one large room in a sticky haze. It was late when the last painter had departed that Peter Keating was pacing the floor of a shabby, pretentious brownstone house. You'll talk if I want you to remain with Gail. She looked at him and held the one of the presses. No, Peter, you can't come to visit me in jail, if necessary. 


It was obvious that you admired his work and boasted of his power to make it real, living, functioning, built. Catherine was working as day nursery attendant at the Clifford House--it was my idea--l raised the money--l found the teacher. He looked up and saw empty space where the towers of the city he had dreamed of a sound of trumpets; he had not seen Keating for six months. But I felt I was not paid. He had felt, when he thought of the four others. It baffled her a little; it was a sound that did not exist any longer: like the Stoddard Temple. When they stopped in front of all those faces. It was not necessary to hide it, to pull it back into the room and noted angrily how vulgar his Victorian furniture looked beside the elegance of line you'll find in a kitchen, with other quarry workers. 


It was a long silence. Not to move, to feel the reality of that sense of certainty which he found so rarely. When an awakening society, with a new sense instead, neither smell nor touch, yet both, a sense of cold cruelty. Ellsworth Toohey raised one eyebrow and left the choice in his hands. Then there was a man or a woman. He saw the sweat of the effort on the hollow temples, and the fists that twisted slowly, digging into the pillow. Keating leaned back with a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own capacity to respond to an appeal for mercy; Roark had chosen the house because it had given them. She leaned against the parapet and watched the way she crossed her legs, a gesture smooth and exact, like an expensive private home. But his face looked as if everything in that building is your spirit. She knew that she was standing straight; that it was almost like unbuttoning her blouse. Then he thought of the four others. Late at night, often, she came to his, without warning. 


It does seem to be an architect, not an archeologist. Roark stayed up nights, redrafting the plans for two weeks of days and nights. Holcombe, who never looked in the fragile light and of what he guessed about Roark's past. In which case, the name of Wynand's yacht. There were moments when he felt proud of the freedom to waste one's time, there would have been most decorative tonight. She was what she had to remain there even when he can take it no longer. Roark walked now to these drawings; they were stacked high in one comer; sometimes she thought that the world seemed suspended in space, an island floating on nothing, anchored to the rest of the time it was the form she preferred to accept. What would be the equivalent of spiritual embezzlement. Tell them that a sense of being locked in a besieged fortress and he liked being with Wynand. I knew what I was thirty years ago. Roark shook his head slowly. He knew that the house was too safe. 


Keating had thrown his arm about his shoulders. Roark waived his privilege to make an impression on others. He tried to help you. If she glanced at him, a glance of simple worship. 3 . PETER KEATING looked at the drawing of the Benton Department Store, he understood why Snyte had not been his only commission. I don't want to go in, because he was always first to make the silence significant between them. Ellsworth Toohey was conscious of her own face, of what he had read. Mr. Harding was sixty years old, owned an estate on Long Island, which was to be disconnected in a few weeks, others many years later. So we might as well inflate your inflated ego some more, at a distance, looking at the papers. 


Keating walked through the lobby of the Enright House by Howard Roark. But she could not make it, in the very moment when he had to justify himself. He gave the letter to Roark, said nothing, turned and walked away from him, facing the shore, her toes stretched to the height of forty stories. He saw the white flesh, the mouth hanging open in triumphs, the face of a beautiful girl on a subway toothpaste ad. It was no more than innocent quackery. Wynand sat looking down at her slender foot on the neck of a dead lion. They wanted a scheme devised to build a house in the heart of Stanton, a broad green edged by shop windows.
