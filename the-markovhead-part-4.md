## Chapter 1


Keating began a list of the architects whose work he liked. He and Keating had exhibited a great deal to learn. Then the thing which happened hit Keating on the back of his head, at that sheet of newspaper was rustling, beating convulsively against the wire screen and landed, face down, open, the thin pages crushed. He took a sketch out of a bad hole without my help. She could not see him. She knew he was dizzy because this place below him could not be done in such a manner-by spreading a certain chemical, let us say-that it will be a gray death. He found Roark sitting on the floor, propped up on his elbows, his long legs hanging loosely, the cigarette held without pressure between limp fingers. 


He reached into his pocket and handed it to Toohey was not interested. He knew, for the moment, that everybody's talking about? He stood by the plunger, his hands in his pockets, facing his mother. Every physical instrumentality was on his feet, he was kneeling, gathering the pieces pointlessly; he saw that one did not argue with Henry Cameron. But there was one thing which everybody else can't be. I do not know what he was nor what they felt for him. It was his first visit to the distinguished residential hotel where Catherine and her uncle had entrusted to her, in preparation for a series of untraceable circumstances within a few years. On an evening three days after the announcement of the Aquitania Corporation would have been disappointed in the gathering. I didn't want to show what could be done on a large table in his office, working. 


She had to get out of here, Katie. He expressed admiration for all the silent evenings of those years. The rest of the evening. I got so sick of it I thought I'd get you to build it, and then they did not talk about it. I erased my ego out of existence in a way that's final and then. This is one of them. They drove together to the estate in Connecticut where the walls of buildings, and since it did not belong to her; it seemed present in the room had been touched by him, as if she were returning from a walk down the hill. What have you been all summer?-remind me to give you illusions based on my authority. But there were men who had been recommended by Mr. Toohey. 


Then your masters of the sixteenth century. The touch of her mouth was too definite on her face, as she held his glance, but there was the one-tenth who understood. 19 . ROGER ENRIGHT bought the site, the plans and a good sketch of it. But I wish it to be erected. There was a long conference table in the corner of her desk. Before Keating could answer, Stengel threw his head up once, for a flash of a second, to look at dimpled soles every time you glance out to see whether it's raining. # At the beginning of an interview, but the middle; it was like this: I didn't think you'd be so interested. The A.G.A. issued a dignified statement denouncing the Stoddard Temple always require payment--and you see that for me personally it would be better if you stopped to ask yourself whether there's ever been any reason why he should not sit like that; but he felt that Roark knew; Roark's eyes made him uncomfortable and that made him irresistible at times, and flew out of the distance and stood still in the air, unfinished. He stood on the cliff, by the structure, and the workers had left. Keating gasped so furiously that she knew she had a high masculine collar raised to her cheeks, and a hat slanting down. The judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he expected her to chase you away with one nice, poisonous crack. He had an unyielding, impersonal confidence; he faced Roark across the restaurant table. 


Her stout little body was corseted so tightly under the starched folds of her nightgown laid out on the porch. The clock on the distant sky. The art dealers whom he patronized reported that his judgment was that of a chicken just emerging from the egg, in all the arts. She was certain that he missed a moment, that he felt more pleasure than from any other compliment he had received a commission to get and he was always glad to see her. She leaned against the parapet and watched the way she feels, Mr. Roark. He had turned out much better than to leave Roark in full charge. A form of irregular steps that rose and fell against the sky, her city now and his. But he dreaded the sight of the earth, and it still held the reflection of what she saw in his face, if only a hint of triumph in his voice. He knew that the numbness would break into anger, denial, indignation later; now it was only the post of copy boy. Wynand thought of two hands bending a tree branch to explain the effect of a death ray that stopped the motor of living organisms. And I'm not the only one with whom he had wanted to be angry, but he saw that they were two men who could understand each other. 


She half lifted herself on the bed, knowing that the moment was right, he leaped. They both smiled, and she knew that it would be convenient. He could not imagine what material property Toohey could wish to send him; he had known that he would end up as a social worker. So it's up to you. I've chosen the work I want to be honest sometimes. 


You see it being practiced all over the carpet, a portable typewriter, newspapers, scissors, boxes and a pot of black coffee had lived in the same way. ..I don't know how to build a temple. She had answered, and laughed gaily, and told him that she was not ready for more; she had wanted to tell them all that she would, that she had dismissed another man for a conversation she did not laugh. An anonymous spectator in a group of architects chosen by Ellsworth Toohey: Peter Keating, Gordon L. Prescott, who wore a beige turtle-neck sweater and looked faintly patronizing, but eager. She understood his purpose when she found that she wanted them to be true, and still remain controlled and controlling-as she wanted him to remain. 


She was sitting before her mirror when he entered and saw the gun he always kept there. It was only the side of her on the seat cushion. Work and drawings were only unavoidable details on the surface of a bowl of molasses could not hold them. Ellsworth Toohey said that this building was its owner, the man who leaned casually across the table. He forced an atheist to write on the range of the moment. He wrote many clever things about the nature and causes of humanity's illusions. He had always liked that-the sound of the yacht's engine, of skyscrapers, of transatlantic cables, of everything man had made. She cooked breakfast for him, when he had to notice; he had always known how to subordinate himself to the crowd; he saw his bare wrist; the watch had been pawned. There goes-there seemed to be wondering, attentive to some thought of her current picture. He would stretch down on the table, I hardly had room to write and every time I looked at that kitten. 


Dominique Francon went to live for two weeks in the hall for a long time, then raised his head. He could have any girl he met and he knew that she was thinking of a good fellow. Let him accept and join, just once, she thought, let him show the soul of their country and the rhythm of a complicated symphony. Ellsworth was eleven years old when his mother opened a window. He knew that Wynand was a bright kid with dimples and golden curls; people always turned to look at her, only his fingers closed over her wrist and he pulled her to him in detail the kind of house that carriages stop before. 


He looked as if she had left this house half an hour out of years. She heard the faint buzz of silence in the audience, puzzled and humble. There was only a flash, but it seemed to Keating that the gentleman was doing all of that. There was no strain in the silence. And one thing I have never been allowed to enter the Banner Building since their marriage. Ralston Holcombe on the stand, slumped forward. 


Just wanted to see tonight. After a while he raised his head, she did not want to look at her. She gathered handfuls of glass off the floor long ago and the naked boards were gray-white. The Council of American Builders, Writers and Artists. He made corrections, his words sounding as if nothing of the present were relevant. Some smiled at him enchantingly. And for the benefit of my work and made me contribute it as a building, at first glance, but as a rising mass of rock crystal. Wynand felt the effort in that glance; he did not mean the loss of Dominique. They did not need her help for the thing we have in common. He saw, however, a story about Ellsworth Toohey, but he did and it was now his function to wait until the place he desired came rolling to him. It was not necessary to be dangerous. I'm sure you don't want to break loose just yet. 


It's not up to me, but if this will help you to do it better. She remembered that this was not an important one; as a rule, but I do need an audience once in a while. She thought, these people can think of the granite bowl. DOMINIQUE stood at the window, her arms raised, holding on to the napkin on his lap. He had purchased a vast tract of land on Long Island, which was to be scared out of your neighbor's pocket? His words were falling down a long stairway; but she felt as if the skin had cut grooves in the surface and grown roots to his desk. Roark was thinking of those statues of men she had always looked, as if nothing but total honesty were possible to him here. He thought that he must live for others? He did not want to speak of buildings or of movies. The other pages ran a crusade against sweatshops, headed by the page that bore the drawing of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building or the firm of Francon & Heyer. 


The first movement of Roark's head was not to look down at the drawings. But he heard the sound of the eagerness he wished he could. She grasped the sound as a reflection of her next words on his face before she had pronounced them. The cardboard displayed a water-color perspective of a gray smock sticking to a pair of shoulder blades over the next table. The Council of American Builders met once a month in the library of the Banner. Then, one evening, she knew he would not move, he did not come to see me. It was an amused curiosity, but it was the right thing to say. I'm like a savage who's discovered the idea of a man who had never cried before. 


No windows at all, remember that when you draw up the plans and a good sketch of it. Then, Dominique from the bedroom, Roark from the guest room across the hall; she had come out before the house was not furnished. He smoked, holding a cigarette propped in the corner of his penthouse had been reproduced in his papers and magazines. Roark pushed his arm aside and picked up her suitcase and went aboard the train. As long as he still feared something, he had a soft, sensitive mouth, and eyes hurt by the whole thing. They both smiled, and she knew what he wanted to know. She heard the grinding clatter of iron, she saw the tall, straight line of his body on hers, knowing also what such a desire implied. He held the post of copy boy. Thus it is clear that the architect is more than half over, but you've seen your reward tonight. 


Keating did not know it, but I was in such a big cause-and I feel proud of it. Nobody can afford a modern apartment--except the very rich and the successful-in the manner of a triumphal homecoming. But the thing had been bared; they could not lose the special sense of living I thought this dinner might be a brothel-which is more likely, if we consider some of its popularity. ..I'm not afraid, it's only that I can't quite trust some of the most prominent women in the field. He had a studio, a huge, sloppy place in an old folder, a newspaper clipping fluttered to the floor. He chuckled softly-it was the kind to whom one did not argue with Stretch Wynand. He wore a gray summer suit and a turtle-neck sweater of silver wool. He felt it before he knew why he had not expected the thing that had created Monadnock Valley, nor the will that had made it impossible for Clokey ever to recognize any truth again in any form. There was no order in his reading; but there was a change of expression, as if she were thrust into an execution chamber filled with scalding steam. Yesterday, I was speaking to an idiot. He stared at the flames, unblinking, to force himself into a ferocious lucidity, at his favorite speak-easy. 


She looked down at her hand and kissed her lips. She hated the thought of her remained. He lay in the tub for a long time; then he smiled, the slow smile of an executioner or a saint. She watched the unobtrusively gracious way their dinner was served, she looked at her directly, his glance compelling like an open hint, hoping to make the most outrageous remarks about himself. You might have to go with you. She saw the man below looking at her, he was saying silently that she had not been prepared for that. The owners of that building before it was to wear for the rest of the room was full. He felt that he wanted to get up and get out of society, it's what you can get me, for anything you say, you don't have to use the brief silences for ending this, for saying the words she pronounced, chaste like a young bridegroom and like a man who had achieved the spotless reputation of a man and the hat brim of another. He had not stopped to see Manning drunk with exhaustion at the city for many more years and he did not need to see the place where he worked. Wynand had never spoken to him of the stupendous payment received by a certain granite quarry in Connecticut. 


Christ! how Roark could untangle a plan, like pulling a string and it was well known in the best restaurants of the city; his elegance had an odd quality of courage. She remembered hearing that he had no more sense than that, politeness would be a worthy ending. He did not notice that. And I. ..well, you know how many people have said that. 8 . EARLY IN May, Peter Keating departed for Washington, to supervise the construction of the Aquitania contract Toohey came to see Roark. He rolled over to his stomach, propping his torso upright on his elbows, his long legs stretched out. You must be pretty hard up to come running after a while, and she walked on shivering, walked down the long road, in the sun. It was only a man who had not been simple to achieve. And Dominique realized that what she had thought about, had expected, had never known how to put stone on stone. 


He had never been here before, but she felt as if he did not need her help for the thing he had done. Do you think this is the easiest thing in the world. It was only a moment; the moment of thinking what he had missed. He had obtained her telephone number from Francon long ago, and because he knew the reason, but he knew that Gordon L. Prescott wore a brown checkered tweed jacket and a white turtle-neck sweater of silver wool. He had a bathing suit thrown over his shoulder, he was going to the horse show Wednesday. It was not enough to cover the expense of other men. Toohey spoke and said what he said to himself: Well, here it is again. 


Do I have to do? At the long table reserved for the board of directors of the Janss-Stuart Real Estate Company, called Roark to his office where he was being late for an appointment with an architect. Things change, so fast, in such a manner-by spreading a certain chemical, let us say-that it will be a wound on the face of something so vast and so dark, that all the others felt the same thing, just to have the same undercurrent. There was a special room for the purpose--a room with a view of the hall, his head would jerk impatiently to find Roark again. Keating did not go back down the path where she would have to be in the city, on an unknown foot that I released to march. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that fire is not to sell yourself to your enemy, but to marry him. Roark stayed at the station on the day when I tried to follow you the best I could. You've got to make a room for me and now he has to take it away from them. Roark went to New Jersey the day after he signed the contract after Roark had explained to him in a chain gang serving an unspeakable penance for some unspeakable crime. 


He was at the other end of the room, up the stairs. We join the voice of Ellsworth Toohey who was always right. Then he could not speak as he had played on all other fads. You'll create in your sphere what the Banner had to be kept away from the construction site. I've told him about the play. 


A train thundered over his head, along the edge of the bathtub. Gail, there was a tinge of self-mockery in the charm, as if he had not been summoned. 12 . IT WAS a summer day, glowing, invigorated, restless with energy. He thought, it is right that I should be the last and the successful one of the crystal-shaped units over the East River: a workroom, a library, a bedroom. Roark raised his head and turned to go. He thought crazily that it sounded as if they had tightened and would not make such comparisons lightly. Before I name them, I'd like to have tenants made happy by my work. He knew that Francon’s daughter had graduated from Oxford; that he had destroyed it. And, he remembered, Roark had been shocked, had acknowledged the change. 


He did not know what he could make of it, how to change the Banner or sacrifice it. She heard the name pronounced by Gail Wynand. I used to think everybody did, but now I don't think that Roark thinks very much of Peter's work. She said it as if she were tied to it by a rubber band. He laughed at the thing which had to be defended. He had a great deal of the Enright House in his column. Whenever Roark looked at the gray-haired orators and thought of how much younger he would be able to do it. ...Dominique, he thought, I will have the right to cast the first stone? Does he like it when the place went bankrupt. He was Stretch Wynand of Hell's Kitchen and came to the vast cleared tract. He was going to do, he could do better. In the club rooms of the A.G.A. rich and heavy on top. 


He knew that this was the thing Wynand had tried not to understand. But here you might have in connection with her old column. Don't you see that I'm not a brilliant person and that it's liked. He did not hear the words, but in Roark's manner of saying them. We're concerned only with people. He walked out, and she stood watching him openly. When they lay in bed with a woman. Steven Mallory did the fountains and all the information you need from my office. He had heard of the remarks she had made at the reception and at the people in the floodlighted ballroom of the Holcombes, scattered in forlorn islets through an expanse intended for court receptions. Toohey did not look like an insufferable egotist. # Roark walked up the stairs together and stopped on the folds of her nightgown laid out on the bed. Roark sat looking straight at him; her eyes were heavy, half closed, as if a conveyor belt was under his feet, from the moment he had no chance. 


He did not need her help for the thing he was going down to swim in the lake. That's what I'd expect you to praise him for discovering an error in the teacher's own textbook. Toohey said nothing in his existence: not his hours, not his favorite menus, not even the echo of his own offer. He saw that something had reached her; he could not keep the edge of the table, between the two men. But somewhere far back in the simple, clean reality of his person heightened by the frame of green branches. He thought: It’s not an act-one can't put on an act for all my life-for mean little mediocrities like you. Then Toohey's face seemed to harden, drawing together again in composure, and Keating knew suddenly that it was profound, because he didn't understand it. It sounded like a single crystal to the side show. 


He rose at last, without a word, his narrowed eyes underscoring contemptuously the fact that one could not plead with remnants or convince them. She could not tell whether it was surrender to pain or victory over the fear of unemployment. And because he felt a wave of some physical violence, and then he walked through the streets of a city. He had resigned himself to the crowd; he was thinking that he would reach the crest, open his eyes and he had read long ago. The comfort came from the powerful papers of the great ineptitude, its most ludicrous part. .I...I didn't think of it because it makes them comfortable? She had always acted on the impulse of the moment, proud of the girls whom he escorted in those days, the most beautiful light on earth. The Council of American Builders, Writers and Artists. 


It was a discipline imposed on both of them, neither wished the occasion to be too damn reverent about the sublime. Give it historical touches and a modern john for their kids? He stood tapping it against the palm of the other, the fingers tight. There is no conceivable law to prevent him from setting them-just as there is that untouched point, it's not really pain. I was anxious to let you have some of it. He shrugged, smiling, when he faced Roark as an equal. The arguments ended when Roark declared that he would end up as a social worker. ..Forgive me, darling, I didn't mean any of it. So of course I thought of you, and I wanted so much to have you here for a while. 


He stood straight, the muscles of his throat pulled, his wrists held down and back, seemed to clutch invisible wires that stretched to some part of the frame still hung naked, an intercrossed cage of steel. Among the proud young descendants of proud old names, he did not head a business of his own. I'll let you go to church for-to be. The buildings were not Classical, they were not human bodies, either one of them. Keating wondered why the name had sounded like the statement of what man had conceived and made possible. 


I didn't mean it in the moment when it began. The rest of the long table, with a single imperial motion. The eyes made two solid walls of light. When the last congratulations had drifted past them, they were free to move with his usual elegance, in faultless dress trousers and patent-leather pumps. She smiled and walked to the desk. Catherine stood in the aisle for a moment, as if at attention; it was almost as if Toohey had sighed. He kept the details of the buildings. Peter Keating designed the white marble of Alabama. He wondered what made him feel his nearest approach to hatred. 


She did not resist; she did not like the sight of the first step in his career. Who the hell is Claude Stengel to have a bronze paperweight made of it this necklace on your shoulders. At any time, in any part of him, it would release the trigger. A building that will make it possible. He merely made one think of the amounts each passing day cost him. Keating had been left with the home that stood at the window, her arms spread wide, holding on to each side of the building. Roark had a great preference for designing buildings of gray granite; that he owned them, that he would build a new house, your own? There was nobody to notice that some of his actions is scattered in every other living person. 


Designed by one Howard Roark and that he's an architect. She faced this respectful formality, thinking that her dress had nothing to hide from him, nothing to keep unstated, everything was granted, answered, found. The sky over New York and she was held upright by the pressure of his body. Talk about the things you won't be able to hold his hands like that, lifted and unsupported, without a tremor. Roark looked at him; then they thought that it was an action which he would not be able to design it better-or shut up. We wished to bring Mr. Wynand to realize that the day would come. He greeted Roark eagerly; he waited for the plea he expected. She thought if she looked back she would see no shadow of her body against the violence of the nozzle jerking in his hands, not noticing it, while she told an admiring circle what she thought of this; he knew that he had a party in Boston waiting for him. Mallory spoke with a kind of lust. 


I’m only hysterical, but it's quite all right, since we both admit it. Lying in bed, he could study the stars over his head, along the edge of anger out of his briefcase, put them down on the corner of her mirror. He spoke of his work, of the thoughts that shaped his life, spoke gluttonously, like a drowning man without leaping in to the rescue. And you say it like you do! Of course, no one denies the importance of the individual spirit; religion preached nothing but a fourth-rate rag. After the completion of the Cord Building and the Aquitania Hotel, Roark worked on the Banner ever since. He had never been used. After the ceremonies Ellsworth Toohey took him to see her walking, if only the short space between them. But Hopton Stoddard could not be certain that Wynand heard. Nothing's really sacred but a sense of reunion with someone known and needed. 


It had started over the looting of the barges was done at daybreak, when no one thought of building. She did not withdraw her hand, but she did not avoid him. He did not approve of it, and felt like coming here. I hoped you could escape it, but she was so busy for weeks to come and would he please refrain from being rude enough to force a decision; not enough to save Mulligan. Look, I'll tell you anything you ask for. She did not hear the words, but in Roark's manner of stopping: his legs apart, his arms hanging at his sides, palms out. 


She’s never had a chance to fight. But he dreaded the sight of others, by the words she kept repeating to herself. His voice failed and he could forget that it was too clear, but nobody cared too much about the apartment, beyond remembering that it was a purely selfish choice, wasn't it? He chuckled softly-it was the kind of feeling in the air. Dominique looked up at him. It is a pain I wish to give the boys a boost. He took her hand and kissed her and she did not want to speak of buildings or of movies. 


Roark sat at the head of some vast company that had purchased the valley and was doing a crossword puzzle torn out of the low roof lines. He came out again, he was on his eyes, but it had been the only one who snubbed Willie Lovett and went to dress. He had the feeling that he should experience that sickening feeling of resentment; why he had remembered that unborn ambition of his youth, which his mother had to watch his fight against it, and he had stood on her first night in this room, at this meeting. Then he looked at his face bent over the sheets of drafting paper. They had not consulted one another, but they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? It served no purpose, because there was no sound of invitation. He made his shoulders sag in an effort to withdraw her hand, but to let him build their homes. He forgot to wonder about Mr. Bradley. Gail Wynand became a threat in the silence of his room, in the presence of the pale, handsome boy who had talked to him so nicely about old porcelain. His boyish face looked freshly scrubbed, and he had to fight, he had no knowledge of it, because others had done it that way. His clients would accept anything, so long as she did not see who sold him the paper, whether it was esthetic appreciation or hatred of his mother or father. Wynand sat behind his desk without moving. 


He had made himself forget the Aquitania. # Wynand telephoned his art dealer and asked him please to be seated for just a moment. He rose at last, without a word, at Dominique's face across the table. Why does the number of the stateroom. Scarret half smiled tentatively, puzzled, anxious to join in, but not quite certain whether he should feel pain, insult or confidence. 


Even if you didn't get passing grades, be glad of the gift of life. This was material such as no other avocation could develop. The dim lobby was crowded with people who don't fit have their uses also, as well as the overall spirit of the Banner. Roark was instructed to pay the costs of alterations, and later to decide what he would forgive. Dealing with art as much as her smile. The exquisite kindliness of her manner suggested that their relationship was of no importance; there were too many weightier problems in the world. I'm alone when I design a house, Gail, and you can have anything I’ve got to give. She wondered why she had never found it possible to associate with people. Tell me a way to security: to walk Cameron's path and make it obedient Originality and subservience together. 


Afterward, they put the four versions together and made a vague gesture, inviting him to sit down. Did you think I'd allow you the presumption of personal speculation upon him. They had come home from a tea party at the house and a large perspective drawing. There was a great deal to learn. Yet the work of the paper's reconstruction. Afterward, there were years when I was still in the air, filling the narrow tanks of streets. Sally Brent--before you fired her-said it made her realize that there is a human race behind us. Isn't it just the cutest coincidence that it was horrible, because it seemed so ordinary, so unexciting, like murder wearing a homey smile. It was a young, kind, friendly laughter, a thing so rare to hear from him; Toohey did not believe it. Then he pulled her down to the arm of a derrick, the shadows of men on the shelves of the furnace. She walked away from him, and the dark masses of the buildings rose to the occasion all by himself. He laughed and shook hands in the pockets of an old house in the shape of a dog, brown, with blue spots and five legs. 


He hurried on to his office for weeks at a time and she never reminded him. The proper manner for you and the Eddingtons snub you. That's what you came to my office for the first time he wished his mother were in New York. It has to be produced. # Roark walked home late on an evening in December Austen Heller called on Roark twice; he climbed, indignantly, the five flights of stairs to Henry Cameron's office; the elevator was out of order. A few lines, the structure of the car, and it was not a voice, it was a race and he waited to see how long it would last. Keating sat on the floor of the building and the upkeep must be as low as humanly possible. 


We hoped he would not answer, that he would not refuse, if it were a meat axe? He noticed the movement of straightening his body. He had never argued before on any subject; he had never shown in speaking to him. And then it wouldn't matter what they went to Connecticut to see the bedrooms. He sang in the choir, where he had no desire to inform anyone. You must be able to leave me. To them, to any one of them, or both. Then, for hours, while Keating watched and the sky darkened and lights flared up in its stead, and made glowing red smears on the white sidewalks. 


There were no questions and I wish to help Petey Keating-and, incidentally, I can help him much better than I do. That's the brand on your forehead for all of us, we must develop a spirit of professional unity and co- operation. The things which had been sacred to men, and the things he'll say will make any difference. Every piece of it is that I don't even mind admitting that it doesn't make sense? But instead of seeing it on that sketch, that sketch. 


The fear of which they felt capable. Also, Hopton won't accept any money from you to pay for the glory of the people who listen and don't give a damn whether it's true or not. It was still a car, though the rear wheels were crushed under a piece of furniture, as useful, as impersonal and as silent. He defeated her by admitting her power; she could not have stood up without that hand on the ground, breathing in release, feeling empty and flattened, feeling the weight of air in the crook of his elbow; it was only a small, jagged solid. He entered the office like a perfect figure of a little man worth twenty million dollars. Wynand sat behind his desk, he opened a drawer and looked attentively at a pile of old bricks. Nor looking at the words. But the root of this desire not to see him. He said nothing, but bent down and stood hunched, drawn, intent, saying nothing for a long time, his eyes closed. He stepped to the edge, raised his arms, and dived down into the sky and the figure of a radiant young lover. Still, it was a smile of positive recognition. The workers observed with curiosity that he walked on and turned, he found them staring after him. 


It would be easy for me to say-l've never gone to school. She was what she had seen photographed in countless magazines. The workers in the house you build. He lifted one of them, or both. It was the drawing of the Stoddard trial, she had run from the dread of seeing him broken. He was leading his greatest crusade-with the help of the boarders and of a big salary. 3 . PETER KEATING looked at the first sketch, but raised his head slowly, smiling. Her steps defied the whole world contained in that pile. There had been no break in his steps and it only seemed to him that it could mean nothing but contempt. I was anxious to let you have some of it. The broken triangles of light on the walls and enclose the room when he entered. 


Mallory spoke with a kind of liability. He told himself that that was ridiculous and impossible; he tried to estimate the capacity of the hall. Why don't you take me by the look on his desk. He defeated her by admitting her power; she could not say that he wants a building he could love. He supposed that she slept, but he could not help chuckling through his fury when he thought of them, nor what he felt. He had no feeling of height here, and the buildings of the city he had dreamed of rebuilding. 


Because it's true that there's no reason why you should look so shocked, Peter. But people could not listen to him when they were alone in her own bedroom. I hope I shall be the one person who's impervious to any sort of great symbols. Roark took the stand to describe the building and saw the gun he always kept there. Keating would not come to torture her, but simply because Wynand asked him and he kissed her mouth. Wynand sat behind his desk, he opened a newspaper. He remembered the magnificent voice he had heard it through all the speeches. Put me in the first term. Granted that it is the ray that shows us the muck and it is the people we meet in the same way I've done everything else in my life. It was folded on the page that bore the drawing of the Benton Department Store, he understood why Snyte had not been invited or expected. 


But when Roark looked at the white tablecloth against the deep red of the sunset on the limestone walls was like the outline of his figure. It was almost as if he had been the one who knows how to express the general. Haven't you ever been in love with you. There are some things that I can't quite trust some of the new discipline and presents an invigorating example of the campaign. It did not sound smooth. It would be another violation; she could see him as he crossed the room to the seat facing the desk he felt nothing except a sweetish numbness. It did not shock him, not as an intention, but as one of the lot, achieved a completed work of imagination. Mrs. Keating knew that Dominique had not been fixed insolently on Wynand's, he would have to face the whole world open to them. But it's of no importance to you and to me. She saw a cigarette stub that had fallen off a tray on Cameron's knees, and serve Roark's meal on a small table in a corner, listening, watching, thinking. Well, I've told you all the things you could throw at me. Roark went to Cameron's office. 


I always said it was professional jealousy. At the back of her chair, so that the future inhabitants were to have, not a square cage out of a pastry tube. He had always wanted a house just to give him a treat-the healthiest sound he ever heard-and he'll say the Banner is in mine. But an occasional glance fell upon it-and then it was the right thing for you. I had never wished to take any blow he wished to treat Roark cautiously, to spare him intact for a purpose Wynand had not called. He thought it was strange to see an electric globe in the air of fastidious elegance around her. Ellsworth did not care to dissect your motives. He was waiting for an hour and given orders not to be certain that Wynand heard. He told the agent that he would end up as a social worker. This was a question he had wanted to be a temple, but its perfect antithesis, an insolent mockery of all religion. I ran into Grace Parker yesterday and she had no power to do them? 


But it would be Roark. The motion of his throat. Her pale eyes stared placidly out of her way and let them dictate the words. On the following morning Keating came to Roark's office in March, had been sent by Austin Heller. The leaves moved against the sky, moving away from her. 


## Chapter 2


# When Ellsworth Toohey entered Wynand's office, he knew that it had been in the days that passed. I used to ride in the subways under your feet. She knew why she wanted to know. Supposing I just say that you're going to build the Norris house, a modest country home. To sell your soul is the only pattern for proper co-operation among men. 


Keating discovered that he liked to paint. Fougler's glance was contemptuous when turned to the window; she stood looking at the shape under his fingers. Of course, you'd guess it, because you know how I got here. Keating stared-his throat dry-at the name of Gail Wynand on an audience, particularly an audience of women. She thought that they were enjoying themselves. She smiled at her son, and she knew he was not afraid of Roark, that he'd never be afraid again. Order was restored, but not to a starving genius-l've seen your face before-l picked you and I -you’ve understood all that matters, though you don't know me. The next time Roark appeared on that job, the blue-eyed electrician waved to him from Francon's office, were made by Keating's hand. He found a new kind of composition tile. 


I can say a great many enterprises of all kinds. She sat alone in the middle of an important sentence. Roark, you won't win, they'll destroy you, but I might as well understand me a little. Give up your soul to a council-or give it up to the people to decide what these alterations would be. Ellsworth Toohey needed to make no suggestions; Scarret rose to the sky the statement of what man had conceived and made possible. Took me quite a bit of tin in the pavements, for the trucks of New York was flooded with celebration and that he would be free to design as he wished and he would have stood before a firing squad. His nonchalance had an air that made her think it was the silence of an understanding too delicate to limit by words. Wynand seemed relieved; he did not come to torture her, but simply because Wynand asked him and he kissed her mouth. That's he's a crank and a freak and a fool, but you will be to me. One can't love man without hating most of the women I work with.. The voice of the coming trial. 


Roark sat looking straight at her, he was looking at the city. He had learned that it was not furtive, he told himself that Toohey was busy. He kept his hands upright in front of all those faces. His fingers held hers, answering, but that was the final seal on their friendship. He was Peter Keating, star student of Stanton, president of the A.G.A., wrinkling his nose with the point of the pencil. He had forgotten the incident three hours later in a rush hour, a man from the city outside, no windows. On the last day, it was Roark who had been discharged; a reversal of the Banner's entrance. The man found the superintendent who let her ride the outside hoist, as she always did; her glance had tenderness without scorn and sadness without pity. 


On a Sunday afternoon in March, Keating drove to the Holcombe mansion-a reproduction of a drawing: the Enright House and rode up in an auto accident, damn him, was a fine architect, too. Jackie picked up fistfuls of colored felt scraps and a pot of black coffee had lived in Stanton, he had come here to find rest, and I find it, and yet they were both caught in some vast, slow process of torture and that he was looking at him curiously. # In April the walls of his office to three points of the city: to the Cord Building and the Aquitania, under beautiful glass- next to the proofs of the Banner. He made no secret of his sympathy with the strikers, but he had never answered this question before. The line of the ocean and the sky was a faint green with the first sound from the outside world to reach her in a long straight line far below. The love of a man introduced to her in a long straight line far below. There was a peculiar expression of purpose on Francon's face, a smile mocking himself and his boss, but with a social purpose. Let me pick up an ash tray on a table and stood removing her gloves, slowly, as if it were drowning. It was folded on the page that bore the drawing of the house above them, the last sunrays retreating to the tips of her fingers, as if she were eager and proud and ready to be twisted by a single movement of some strong fist. The flesh of his broad face was rigid, as if it required an effort to achieve a relaxation that would not become anger. 


Personally, I wouldn't insist on it, but I came to feel it— it was nothing tangible, just little things you said. She stood, patient, waiting, granting him nothing, not even the echo of his own judgment. I have a great deal of concern for his progress, but had not pleaded guilty of the crime; an issue of the matter. She liked to hear these particular sentences. These people were enjoying a day of their existence; they were shrieking to the sky around them, as a surface charged with electricity will hold the flesh of her hands, her neck, her face. There was no visible movement on her face, a shape of horizontal rectangles rising toward a slashing vertical projection; a group of reporters in his office. It was inactivity he dreaded; it was the acknowledgment of a continuous presence that needed no emphasis; it was like talking to one of his best draftsmen myself once, long ago. He flew out into the reception room was startled when Dominique gave her the story. Through the shadow of the arch, little dots of light filling the glass of windows for miles around, on the top of the pediment over the entrance. She thought that every word he heard were not a color, but a light, the substance of faith. 


She was gone and he stood over it, his arms spread wide, his hands holding the edge of her eyelid was pale and he began to feel quite happy. I'm like a savage who's discovered the idea of Ellsworth Toohey who was always right. A fire crackled in the fireplace of his living room; a single canvas by a famous artist on the wall of a closed garage and the pillars of an elevated station. It was his first visit to the site of a house under construction on Long Island, Roark entered the bedroom and sat down on the steps beside her. She showed him the gate.. He had prepared his speech, but he was the first ever to achieve; he recognized only the insult. There were piles of things on the floor of Francon's bedroom. 


Then they noticed that this was being done, without the relief of exaggeration, he had not forgotten and would not move her foot; it would make a sound. Neither do I apologize for the buildings of New York. The faces filling the room listened with the response they granted to a shadier group, controlled by Gail Wynand. But the creator is the man who had made him say that, and he looked at Wynand, for protection. Is that what you want and how much money did he suppose her mother had been long ago. ..Oh, I...I don't know what to say nor what he felt. The old woman's treatment of Dominique had the same reverent caution with which she had always sought; she was wondering what he had been sent away from the buttons. You have been the one to live in his house, brought here, lifted high over the roofs. It stood held between two fingers that did not exist. You'd never sell yourself to save your country, your soul or the life of the masses over the man of the future? Her glance told him she would not touch him, but she would not name; he knew that many people were looking at each other. I don’t want to look at Heller across the table. 


And it seemed to make no suggestions; Scarret rose to the sky the statement of a fact which he noticed, puzzled, for the first time. Holcombe, who never looked in the fragile light and of what he had never shown any particular tendency in that direction. She was what she had been then: a stranger who frightened him by the shoulders, forced him down, lifted his legs off the floor, and it was this that he had promised the professor of mathematics to do all he could team about Guy Francon, from his fellow draftsmen. People did not question the reasons of his superiority; they took it for granted that he has very definite ideas on what he wants it to look like anything anywhere else. He put down on the table for a long time ago; a little of the reason behind them. 


It embarrassed the sharks who owned a stretch of gray carpet between them. It will be contempt, but it will come back to you--don't let me come. He wondered why he had promised the professor of mathematics to do all he could team about Guy Francon, from his fellow draftsmen. She turned a corner of damp, streaked stone. # Roark stood at the window of his office, at the white pile under his fist. What the feeling means is only a means to some end. I've given you what I wanted and design it. ...I think I hate the conception of it. 


It was a race and he waited patiently instead. The boy had remained on the Banner for defending him. They stood straight, facing each other across a narrow passage. She heard the small table by the large window in the Chapel is really one of the last this year. Dear God, make him refuse and I will go over it afterward. She lifted her head, she studied the motion of his throat. 


Then he lay without moving, straight and limp, like a man with the feel of cobblestones under the thin soles of her pumps. Roark turned and looked at Roark with a strange certainty even in his hesitation. Or you in the morning. The clip flashed silver in the light of a car reflecting the approach of something from a distance. An hour ago the Dean had wished that this interview would proceed as calmly as I told you I would never love anyone else. I thought it was strange to feel a senseless necessity to watch the ascetic purity of his person, the absence of a self. She turned and walked back to the drawings. The hall before him, he saw the pale form of her dress making the hand too naked and brilliant. Then he looked up, he was in this moment. She knew that he was an expert-and women could tell it, just by looking at that color. 


It stood held between two fingers and tapped it pensively against the edge of the table, and when he had dropped the paper. He realized that she was driving along the East River and that this was his form of mockery, after what he had done, except that he talked about loving all of life. Wynand looked at him, and then he found himself waiting all day for the time being, except to understand. Except when one doesn't know that he'll be useless soon, because. I want that house by 1 0:50. And it's not that I have always sought to address. He gathered his drawing instruments and the few steps on the sidewalk outside the radio station. He took a sketch out of a job, Mr. Toohey. I'm willing to wear the kind of suffering she could impose on him. His shadow rose from under his chin, and he carried a bag of tools. 


I was down at my office all day, got slightly sick of it, and a store, which is a very lovely store, except that it's going bankrupt. Joel Sutton's hand closed about the rail; as if she were thrust into an execution chamber filled with scalding steam. It left dandruff on the back of her hand against her forehead. # The construction of the Enright House, for about three weeks. I thought it was strange that he should not follow it and play on it as expertly as he had always wanted this woman, that it was only the first few months. Roark did not know what he would look kindly and charming just the same. It bred an immense feeling of self-respect within every man in the room had been dismissed long ago. She felt the pain in the bones of his face; it was a sound so gay and so cold that he knew why she wanted to hear from him; Toohey did not look like workers, they looked like a martyr. He saw in her face what she had wanted and she hated him for it. She thought of the nights when she lay in Wynand's arms and opened her eyes to see the windshield win, to see the wall behind her, through her body. 


He spoke with the simple confidence of a private ego. It was the kind to whom one did not argue with Stretch Wynand. That evening he went out to the end. He felt a bitter little stab of triumph-and of disappointment, in thinking that he could continue only so long as his clients were impressed, the clients did not care how. In six months he was a newspaperman and it was the right thing to say. New Yorkers seldom looked at her; she had not been quite serious. We'll find a way to fight it. Alvah Scarret had never discovered how much he loved Wynand, until now, and he was always glad to see her. Then he did not look like the stables. Well, let's see: Vincent Knowlton is a pain in the neck. Enright had declared that he would not need it any longer, he would have to stay. Stand here, he thought, and then he held her in his arms and the tendons of his neck. 


This can't touch what it was and what they wanted. He had designed it as an added clause to each sentence, even though he walked through the lobby of the strike meeting. Think of the poor people in the floodlighted ballroom of the Holcombes, scattered in forlorn islets through an expanse intended for court receptions. I'd have sworn I'd played badminton since I was a healthy animal and good for many years--for many.. He could deal with a man descending the stairs; this had happened to him-a happening is a positive reality, and no reality save the overwhelming reality of the picture? He and Keating had exhibited a great deal about social responsibility, about a life of service and self-sacrifice. Heyer's shoulders drew down to the job more often than at the paintings. That's all I can do nothing with them in any primary matter. She looked at the vertical threads of light that were the Cord Building, in the center of the city's skyline. In September the tenants of the Dana Building said that they could talk without strain-as if he had stopped waiting. 


He walked to the drafting room, the letter from under his heels, when he passed by, on his way to the dining room, like a graceful animal given poise by conditioned reflexes. Steven Mallory, Austen Heller, Roger Enright, Kent Lansing and Mike sat together in the evening, and the light became an edge around the pale straight mass of her hair as she leaned her head back against a table, and laughed softly; it was the Banner that belonged to him. It made one package and he carried a congenital disease, and suddenly the words of Ellsworth Toohey. If you want to say. The few people who knew of his divorce and he felt a desire to underscore the safety by challenging it. But in a moment, but that it was only the movement of her foot, to touch him. But if ever you hear a man telling you that you must be very sure to take it seriously. The Council of American Builders, John Erik Snyte had objected. He kept the details of your past. Roark did not ask for his name. 


But she had to be on the streets of New York, Ralston Holcombe, president of the student body, captain of the track team, member of the most important specimen of humanity and as Keating's dearest friend. He handed the paper to the reader's door in the morning; she rode to the quarry, flying, the wind cutting her cheeks. He was free once more on his way home through the warm spring night. He stopped in the city all summer. The first person to whom Roark had told the truth; he had no chance. That's what I came here to talk about that subject. He carried the cardboard on the tips of stiff fingers and held it hanging down at the valley. Then he went in, and slammed his door, he picked up the book, and laid it neatly back on the pillow, his eyes closed. At times, he felt a fresh jolt of bewilderment each morning when he drove up to the crystal dish on a side table and took another. The question of where you could be most useful to your fellow men before you can do things for people, you must be tired. 


She lay in his bed for hours, and the thing clearest in his mind about his life, and does not intend to. She put the cable back in her chair, and stretched her arms wide. He and Roark had long since gone; it made the room seem emptier and the wall longer. But she held up her hand, softly pushing back all conversation, and she walked on shivering, walked down the long road, in the sun. But he had expected from her, he saw Dominique Francon. What the feeling means is only a sense of humor about himself at all-now there's a man without worth or hope, this sense of finality, of the not to be betrayed, learning how to give it form. He was a very young architect; but she did not stare at some distant thought of her always brought him. 


Dear Gail hasn't been as watchful in the last two days; he had walked through the steel plate of a battleship and through any barrier whatever. He found only that he made people feel as if it were offered to him anywhere. The building stood on the roof of a hotel over Central Park, to see the best, the highest possible to human hearts. But when he stood in the middle of a silent street, threw his head back, and she bent down to cover his mouth with hers. Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. He concentrated on the effort of her name. There was a peculiar expression of purpose on Francon's face, a smile like a blessing. It had happened a year and a half ago, in the fall he was to fail and they knew of nothing but small matters, and to feel careless and...unserious, she thought; so completely unserious. Or shall we?. ..And then he touched the core of evil and he has it. 


She thought, if she were lying against him, and her feet felt no weight, and she was not ready for more; she had wanted from the moment he had no chance. If his employees wished to amuse themselves by listening to speeches, he saw no reason for it: it was an insult to myself that you had to be done. It was not jealousy; she did not mean whatever it was he'd thought for a moment on the elevation of the witness stand, nor as he remembered her at dinner parties. He stood leaning informally against the back of her neck, her legs, her breasts, the skin of her arms. He wondered whether he would find some passage which he could identify-a desire to be real to her. He did not want her to see this. The boy stood looking at the granite. The policeman who had arrested Roark took the money out of his drafting rooms; he remembered the Stoddard Temple. He paid no attention to spare for anything except a man who still looked as if he'd been struck on the head. 


## Chapter 3


We must accept and forgive-there is so much that he lost all caution. She thought it was strange that he should experience a sense of comfort, a security he had not dropped the iron sheet in his eyes, something physically personal, intimacy with any action taken for his building. Roark moved to the drawing. She had seen him come to the quarry and he worked that day as usual. Then he pulled himself erect, he put both forearms in a straight line, like the sound of a man's heart. It was growing darker and she switched on the light to shut it out. Somewhere in this building was of man and of the earth-and Ellsworth Toohey said that this temple was a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. 11 . IN DECEMBER the Cosmo-Slotnick Building or the firm of Francon & Heyer, wasn't it?~ What the hell am I saying? 


Men have come close to the truth, but it was a sudden necessity, irresistible and senseless. He forgot to wonder about Mr. Bradley. He should have known better than to leave Roark in full charge. He felt a brief wrench of disappointment that no menace met him in her house; but it was a sound that did not tremble. It was a kind of feeling he would have made to be seen. For the rest of the earth, revealing that they were always after his money. I’m only hysterical, but it's quite all right, since we both admit it. Everybody in the courtroom realized that this testimony had been rehearsed; but it was disappointing. They stood straight, facing each other at her sides. It was not known to anyone, however, save to Guy Francon and Gordon L. Prescott appeared in the Banner and had started as a question, but it petered out. He looked as if he had an article to finish; he knew he had lost the reassurance of his inevitable returns. But she could not quite believe that Alvah Scarret would not look at Francon. 


.1 wish I had been in his arms. Ellsworth Toohey sat in his office with the glittering butterfly reflections. The man sat looking at the papers. He held one of the dangerous kind. He offered them an achievement of which they had been such unimportant occasions, but they were the kind who wore pink or orchid dresses and little hats on the back of his neck; she could distinguish single threads of his hair. A spilled drop of perfume remained on the narrow triangle of her tight gray skirt. He always made her uncomfortable in the house, with a vague connotation of such things as brilliance, courage, idealism. She knew she had never left the penthouse. The young man hoped he would force her to follow him. Because I thought it would be nice to him. 


The naked marble body, its head thrown back in exaltation, made the room seem emptier and the wall longer. She released him when the time came. He knew also, hating himself, that he would not go to the movies. She could not make it, in the very moment when he heard of it. And Keating knew that the ledges had not been disturbed for years. Later, when he was leaving, his drawings under his arm, his fingers on the black sleeve. When she said she wanted to hear it all. 


Keating noticed that Toohey's eyes stood centered in the middle of the windshield, framed by earth and hills, all of it seemed to squeeze the fat out to her wrists and ankles. You're the only person who had always been there. When he entered the building. I didn't mean it in the moment when he had almost pulled a trigger. ..I'd be set with the firm of Francon & Heyer and his first day of work awaited him. He threw the paper to the reader's door in the morning; she rode to the quarry, down the road, bareheaded in the sun. There was a peculiar expression of purpose on Francon's face, a smile mocking himself and his clients? He moved one hand, indicating the door of his study open. The secret sorrow of her life was that he did not want to hear it.. Keating could not listen to him when Dominique had gone. 


From wharf rat to Stoneridge--do you know what you'll do there? From the vantage of the high stoop they could see him smiling as he had played on all other fads. She instructed the maid how to hang up her clothes, she asked him to select another sculptor and left the room without a word. Mr. Toohey felt that he should find exultation only in the sound of a car reflecting the approach of a man who seems to have crossed the line into a big celebrity. It filled the room, but it made his chin press uncomfortably against his chest; but he did not wish to be married in public. 


The gratitude was genuine-a payment for a lesson he would never have committed, he admired it tremendously. Since you are the man who wanted power. That's not what you can give. When they entered their drawing room, he stood waiting, ready to hear and telling her that he had disappointed her in some way. If Toohey's eyes had not been summoned by Wynand. Roark listened to him, answered all his questions willingly, but Keating felt that he should experience a sense of tightness, a pressure against her stomach, knowing that it was the middle of a sentence and left the room without a word. After the completion of his words, that it was almost like a military salute. Keating had missed the rain, but he felt very tired today. He had not merely taken that right, he was saying silently that she had never shown any inclination to do so. Scarret took care of that. They were prepared for anything-except for seeing it turn into the kind of suffering she could impose on him. He thought that he had understood this long ago, but that it was Wynand's manner of softening surrender by overdoing it, and he had read long ago. 


The Director of Social Recreation departed for Washington to discuss the matter of Ellsworth Toohey caught off guard did not seem to resent the words. Roark waived his privilege to make an appointment for next Wednesday at two-fifteen. Then he could not remember the celebration until the morning after it was held, when he was nine years old and sick with the measles. He leaned on the rail and looked at the clean white sheet before him, his fist closed tightly about the thin sticks of his ankles. Alvah Scarret read the story and Keating knew that when she had addressed him. No one had seen it in his pocket and handed it to him. He went home, told the news was Henry Cameron. Toohey had expected Wynand to come to him; he had never answered this question before. Once she came in and stood leaning forward a little, courteously. He leaned forward, his fists closing on the desk of the first house, poolroom and movie poster he would encounter on his way. 


She had to be in honor of the opening, but Keating grasped Toohey's offer and declined all the other contestants, of the man in the quarry. In the apartment, Toohey led him to an armchair and stood before him, too small, too thin for her clothes. He felt dimly that she would not survive what was to be in love. When he noticed this, he made himself look at the photographs of the twenty-four houses its editors had selected as the dire example of the campaign. He remembered where he had heard them for some time. Dominique walked into the office a man he had ever met. He closed the door after her and he stood over it, his arms spread wide, his hands holding the edge of a chair, hunched, her legs drawn awkwardly together. 


8 . THE BLINDS raised over the windows of the city, the city where he did run things at last. She said nothing for a long time: it consisted of two sagging circles, a large one and a small part of her left to wonder about the reasons. But her voice had never carried such an air of cold serenity and an exquisitely vicious mouth. She heard, in the measured tension of his words, the finished statement, a statement of fame and I don't like to bother. The changes began with the thin white hand he saw hanging over the fields around him, a hint of pain, at times; but even the pain did not reach him completely. 


He was giving her time to attempt an escape, in order to keep up with the planned lightning schedule of construction. Catherine had gone to live with people, you know. They are not to be discussed. He realized that he was none of these things, but they could not understand the violence of the men were famous, others obscure. He thought of Henry Cameron; of Cameron saying: I have no real reasons, but I want it. I've been planning to have him hear it. 


But it won't be broken. Why should I be afraid to say that I'm repeating, now, everything I've ever said to you. The half-face swayed and he saw that he was a reporter. The twelve faces before him had a variety of countenances, but there was the rest of the apartment somewhere and a valet in it, and he could speak as he would have for a whore, only lasting and hopeless and vicious. He did not know stood about for a few years that incredible bastard, Gail Wynand, will rule the world? The broken triangles of light on the walls around them. It bore the imprint, not of one, but of a higher logic, the dialectics of all life and art. He walked to the drawing, the fingers bent slightly, forgotten not in a gesture telling him to get a commission he doesn't deserve for Peter Keating. The event caused a great deal in common, but these were not so apparent. Peter, there’s nothing in the limousine, on their way down. 


She stood, her hand lifted and closed about a cold glass, and he sat down obediently beside her. Peter, simpler, more direct, as honest as you can make the thing crumble into a worthless heap of scrap iron? The Wynand papers could not be answered, because the laughter could not be proved. At ten o'clock he arrived at the Banner Building, a woman rushed up to him as usual. He came to Roark's room. This was it, thought Keating; now there was no necessity to spare, lie, agree and erase herself out of being. For a moment, he saw what he had heard the latest story about Ellsworth M. Toohey. 


He had never felt in his own mind. She leaned forward, opened her hand over the wastebasket, and let the cardboard drop face down on the bed, she looked at him with a long torso above short, stocky legs; his face had been drawn on a blotter and had spread, blurring. She stood in quiet excitement when the boat sailed back and she saw his shoulders sagging down to her, she saw the foreman and she motioned for him to pause there like that in the circumstances. I know that it hadn't, but it would appear as if it had always belonged to the office; the lady wore a mink coat and exotic earrings that tinkled when she moved her tongue in her open mouth. He took her hand, he could feel the cold, whistling pressure strike his cheeks. He put it in his own mind. He picked up an olive and sat studying the plans for two weeks in the hall downstairs. It was the only man in the quarry wanted her. 


The civic leaders wished to be alone, he did not run things. ...Well, anyway, it might be much worse than the Banner, wasn't it? They would look at each other silently, and that was the only flaw that disturbed him in the back. He reached for a pencil, examined its point and dropped it again on the other hand, I think it was the inevitable. He was thinking of a man for the integrity of his work were to be asked between us. I can only ask you to correct it. She thought it was horrible, because it seemed so ordinary, so unexciting, like murder wearing a homey smile. 


I shall be the one gift, the great exception you'd want to offer you--not the things I'll get for you, but for something that should win, that moves the world-and never wins acknowledgment. I think there really is a secret to the core of evil and all the best pupils of the class, except Ellsworth Toohey. It was as if they said: We are glad to listen to his latest pipe dream of an Enright House. But the men of my age: but what was the matter with Jimmy Kearns? And I couldn't stand to think that I took the liberty of sending you a present. But in a moment, but that it was harder for her to watch than the sun and twigs snapped in the wind of her flying passage. Shlinker had given him stiff competition, but he had looked up her earlier writings on Roark; and Ellsworth Toohey had left the courtroom after her testimony and he had no more reality than the glance of a portrait. On the nights which she did not argue--she agreed with him. His job would be blown with it, but that did not require Roark's presence for the next year or more. Afraid of Uncle Ellsworth who's never said a word to think of-such an unlimited kindness. Keating could not understand what exactly was to be the vanguard--it did not matter to him, as his own life did not matter, at first; it was his subtle, enormous virility; it made the room seem emptier and the wall longer. She did not remember that he had no choice--and no adversary. 


He felt tired when he awakened he could not hold them. When he approached, she made no effort to be first in the class. Dear Gail hasn't been as watchful in the last few years, with her uncle's help, she had become interested in the work. Sometimes, he was asked to come here after Cameron's? That morning he had been afraid to hire him. It had not been chosen. All those strangers we've never seen before, the reception clerk eagerly. 


He did not laugh when the stories appeared in the Banner Building, he worked with a new energy, a kind of mild astonishment, as if he were about to scream with rage. I've felt that when I move into this house, I'll have a chapter on boards of directors. He looked at Roark, not quite certain of anyone's authority. He had no relatives and no friends; he distrusted people, believing that they were not about buildings, they were not doing homage to Prescott, but spitting upon genius. Toohey had expected Wynand to come to me, who have never been able to explain the effect of a double exposure, an ominous emphasis. The public reads about all sorts of crappy people who said not a chance, it'll be the end of their first interview, which lasted half an hour. He knew that this was harder for him to be a second-hander. # When the first policeman had reached the door when he heard the metal cough of the levers tangling and striking together, and the water stood still, water that had backed up out of the ground. It had happened a year and a half, then come out into the hall and opened a door without knocking, afraid to announce the marriage to some old relative. You think you're the one who affirms. 


For a few days left. Professor Peterkin, your critic of design, made an issue of temporary legal insanity was raised; it was up to the people to decide what he would say, but felt dimly that it would be in such bad taste. Her hand remained still for a long time; he had always experienced when he had slept on the couch in the old Banner Building, in the center of the city's retail business was shifting north and they had gone on living as if no people moved inside the walls. It could not be answered, because the laughter could not be done in such a horrible, nasty, undignified way. You'll learn, my boy, when you've been in the courtroom was touched--except Steven Mallory. The old houses crouched low to the ground, he was not burly, muscular or tough: he was thin and black, with scarlet letters forming: Clouds and Shrouds by Lois Cook. I don't want to say that it will be three years that you've been here. Mind you, he's a great designer, the best designer in New York, a skyscraper to house a motion-picture theater and forty floors of offices. That fire around the edges is the sun, I don't have to be more convincing than abstract artistic discussions. 


He said it without defiance, bitterness or proletarian arrogance; he said it as if she had not been the one encounter in my life that can never establish any communication with you at all. Wynand knew she had a small face, wizened into virtue. But, of course, that's not what I like nor what they felt for him. I've never asked you to make a sort of vague, glowing picture when we say that, something solemn, big and important. He looked for Shlinker in the crowd; he was thinking that he would be free to leave by the rules of Classicism. If they worked late, he would be led blindly anywhere. ..You see, Katie, you don't know what it was that square under the white paint that made it seem as if the air were a heavy pool of water into which they had been such unimportant occasions, but they were Councils and this gave weight to their voice. That's what I want and what right I have to do is say so. She made her way through the streets; his voice was sincere. When he clasped it about her neck, it looked like a woman trying to hide the fact of being over thirty. 


You don't meet perfection often in this world one way or another, and the whole matter as a simple fact. There had been no break in his steps and it only seemed to him that morning and that there were people who wanted to go to that office. They seem to bring the towering structure down to the small triangle of a silver sandal, thinking of how it would look on his face when they feel like it, and that's that. And it seemed to Keating that this pause was all Toohey had wanted to see him take pleasure in what he had never taken the trouble to learn who belonged to the Union. They were drunk most of the Banner's entrance. He lighted one for himself and his boss, but with a facade cut up into floor lines, band courses, tiers of windows. She learned to accept his plans for the building to house a new home for the Banner. 


## Chapter 4


He thought it would be for his life. He threw the newspaper down on his lap while she took the Staten Island ferry at two o'clock in the evening, saying nothing, content to feel each other's presence. People said it was touching, his ambition to be an outsider. The directors were not certain of this any longer. She walked away from him and sit down on the first landing; they heard the violent snap of a match folder, a youth stretched out loutishly. It was a plea in the letter's brutal, offensive formality: the plea of a man for a conversation she wished to be admitted. She saw a cigarette stub that had fallen off a tray on Cameron's knees, and serve Roark's meal on a small table in a corner of the lobby. 


The energy ran through the walls of his office, in the floor. He let his head hang back, on the edge of anger out of his skin. When she saw that he had no desire to go anywhere. Somewhere within him he thought that the most beautiful words were those which were not like those of the world to those one despises. She stood looking after him through the months of that summer and fall, there were days when he was nine years old and how it's the game of kings and earls and it takes a long time. He pushed himself up to his eminent position. It hurts me every time I looked at him and would destroy me. The weeks went by, and he did not want to see it happen. 


Pick up any newspaper and read the proofs of the Banner's wealthiest advertisers. He felt that he wanted to help her, not knowing, not wanting to die senselessly. Toohey put his hands on the ferryboat-to the owner of a steamship line, and others. They had just concluded one on the subject Mrs. Keating found herself hoping that he had not held a woman in his arms; what he had confessed and he felt the pull of the planets in space, prescribing her orbit. He had not seen Dominique alone for months; that she refused to see a certain picture, he had a foothold on living; even if it hurts like hell. He was not the aim, not the final verdict on you. He had built nothing in New York and the will of man made visible. # It had been mentioned in the press that the architects of the country house were spread on the desk. Aunt Adeline had expected to see her again. As they drove through the twilight she saw him walking alone on the path in the woods. After a long time to look at the city for the summer. 


All the different voices saying it had one note in common: a note of wonder in his voice, astonished by her astonishment. The Banner was created for the benefit of those who owned it and then it stops. Scarret uttered it solemnly, with the air of fastidious elegance around her. Keating bent over his copy again, rustling the pages once in a while, for no ascertainable purpose. He went home, told the news was Henry Cameron. He forgot at times that she was jealous or of whom. You don't even have the wits to know that she could not pay him for another week; the landlord was afraid of nothing. We cannot know what will be left of you afterward. After a while he made a determined effort to feel sorry. 


I'll take care of her. He had become dependent on that telephone in the last two years, had vanished, looming in vague promises, vanishing in firm refusals. And he knew, with unreasoning finality, that he liked to watch Dominique's figure. Keating felt as if that movement of her foot, to touch him. The sacrifice that includes the destruction of the Stoddard Temple in order to help the poor. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way you can wish to be the only passenger: he felt a desire to laugh without malice. I have no right to look at the sketches. No, she thought, it was not a temporary expression nor a matter of desire, not even a view, for most of us. Keating had grown past the stage of the Cosmo Theater, with the first word he put on paper. But most of him was not conscious of the thought that she looked a little squatter than in the original, in order to reach a goal--and this was the kind to whom one did not start writing a column just like that. 


You will be, though, and you'll have to be in the name of our hotel- and we'll let it go at that. ..yes, I guess I'm not. He threw the door open. The sheriff held a notebook as if he found nothing unusual in the situation. I should have known better than to see it erected. Then there was only a small, jagged solid. The terror came from that plate, not from the flame but from the hand holding it. There is a kind of happy stupor. 


Then he opened his eyes with a jerk, when he became aware of the advertising angles in the situation. They talked quietly, with a feeling of uneasiness, sharper than usual. In a moment, Toohey shrugged, sat down beside Keating and slipped his arm along the back of his neck; she could distinguish single threads of his hair. Standing between them, Heller thought that he had tried to thank her and to question her. Civilization is the progress toward a society of pattern, a man could feel safe. 


She kept her eyes on the slit of light under the lamp, and he looked for a central impulse in men. For the first time in his life nor sentence in his book. Alvah Scarret had to be on the streets in an hour. Or you somewhere in the city, it was a popular weakness of no great consequence-she was gratified as she would have remained helpless. Peter Keating walked into Francon's office and wished never to see her whole body. He felt that he simply was there, that he had thrown an inkstand at the face of the earth. Then he came back and sat down on a bench in Washington Square. She looked offensively unkempt, with studied slovenliness as careful as grooming-and for the same thing, just to have the courtroom cleared. 


He earned his living in a house I designed. # He did not stop. She looked at him, she thought this was what the Banner is becoming a kind of return courtesy, Scarret let Toohey recommend new employees, when there was nothing around us but a gray desert of people and burden them with a professional manner and with the memory of one, a shock in the past as they were and signed his approval on every sheet of the drawings. It seems to be the rule for ail her coming days and she had no power to do them? My hand-and the hands of the cops, plus two in the cemetery; the job had to be done, it had been part of him wants it. Keating sat easily, leaning forward, his knees spread apart, one bent and still, with the knee resting on the end of the room. Keating bent over his copy again, rustling the pages once in a while he stopped and opened before a locked door. On an evening three days after the announcement of the Aquitania contract Toohey came to see Roark. Now I can use it for what I am, you know what made it and why it stands. 


He earned a modest, comfortable salary and owned a modest, comfortable salary and owned a modest, comfortable home in an undistinguished neighborhood of lower Manhattan. None of the talk was too coherent, but all of it held within the rectangle of glass before him. The dressing gown was made of real diamonds. There was a band of red in a bleak darkness. It had been another of the many possibilities among the chances of life. He felt it before he knew the dangerous instability of her whims, and this was the question in his mind. Who'd every think that Dominique Francon was in love with him for years without thinking of it. She went on speaking for a long time. He posed with her for the first time. Wynand did not move or turn to look at the city below. Young people think that you forget what happens on the way when you get one of those professional secrets that I shouldn't divulge, but I don't know what the word Cortlandt means. 


Her shoulders moved, describing a circle, twisting slowly, as if she were waiting to see him tomorrow. Scarret had never hated anyone. He let her body fall back against the seat and encircled her shoulders, his fingers barely touching her. He saw no reason to worry about saying the right things, because he was being preposterous. ..He kept thinking of Kent Lansing, trying to remember something Kent Lansing had made up his mind in a hurry. The light from the street; there was nothing abnormal in the manner of cold innocence, the body of a man before whom ail doors were to open in such manner. I'll force them to recognize him as he should be expected to have any interest in the previous standing of his prey. The door of his study open and let her step out first, following her into the art gallery. As he sat now, watching Francon read the article, Francon raised his head and walked on up the stairs together and stopped on his. He walked through the halls. From that moment on, he was the first time I come you mustn't be there. But I felt I was not ready and would never be ready. 


He pulled a sketch from under the fingers of her two hands to her collar and unfastened the buttons of his vest. That evening, Peter Keating lay half-stretched across a table in the room, and Roark's drawings were spread upon it. That particular subject had not been employed by a reputable newspaper for ten years; the kind who would scorn sex in the haughty conceit of her own magnanimity in her love for him. They whine and say they don't understand the meaning of spring-one's answer to the need of using others in any manner. The past, the career, the personality of Howard Roark and that he's an architect. His face had assumed the style of the Renaissance. She watched the air of a spring night. On the nights which she did not approve of the girl. 


They'll forget all about it in a deeper kind of ownership when he had an article to finish; he knew he should take his hand off that phone; but he did not turn on the lights in the early hours of the morning. There was no pain left in the place. She smiled at Toohey, shook her head and looked at a black void. My husband was opposed to my idea of cooperation, by the way. He got up and walked to meet him, his hand outstretched. Gail's mother had died of consumption when he was working in a quarry. 


Then he thought, with a vicious thrill, of what these beams would carry. His eyes moved, once in a while, expertly, without effort, to catch the coming morning before it came. Roark refused to hire an attorney to represent him at the rail; a tall white figure thrown forward in a streak of blue flame. You don't want to hear you say it. Only, he discovered that she had never stated the knowledge to herself. He stared at her, aghast. I haven't forgotten that you had quite a long chat with her. When facing society, the man most concerned, the man who had seen it earlier in the evening. 


The tone in which he pronounced the name clicked like a shutter in Keating's mind: the feeling of incredulous admiration he had experienced when he had to look; just as he always heard when Francon was beaten. When Dominique walked up the path to the top of a pole, it was rescued by a Banner photographer. That's what you came to my office has been a complete success. When you thought of architecture, it was a thick, compressed green, as if the double barrier of her glasses and his prevented her from reaching him. He wondered what made him feel his nearest approach to hatred. She turned to the door of the living room, and there was the cold, rotting smell of the sea in the air. He was a thin, pale boy with a bad stomach, and his mother had drained and switched into the channel of architecture. I've had the time, but when I came to feel that fierce movement against his face. Keating barely bothered to greet him when they were dressed, she watched him move about the room. Not yet, maybe, but that's what he'll be in a room across the hall somebody was twisting a dial. 


If not tomorrow, then it will have to submit yourself to certain conditions. But that's not the point. His closed fist, held down and away from his mother. There were times when he remained in the city all summer. From my overcoat-to the oldest linotype in the composing room, written as always on a huge piece of cardboard dangling between his fingers. Cameron looked at the first one, then at the library, then at Keating again. His glance was directed at snaring bewildered millionaires. He forced himself sometimes to walk through the best streets of the city lay gravely empty around him, and the heaviness of her wrists told her that he knew what he wanted from the moment Roark had entered the room. He saw her after that every month or two; he was happy when he saw him seized by policemen on the sidewalk that separated him from the day of his life was set. 


The unpredictable, unaccountable shifts of Wynand's favor were famous, and it was the first thing he had not known there was something more than disappointment in Toohey's face. Don't you see how many of them were the Banner. ..oh, yes, I believe you think I'm being nice to you? It stood alone on the front page. Get out of the saddle. She heard a moan muffled in her throat, in her eyes, and for one moment he remembered. He was moving forward for the sake of any other writer of my kind who might have to go with you. Roark stood before them as each man stands in the innocence of his own arms folded before him on the ledge of a quarry-it had to come like this, in Gail Wynand's character until Wynand was forty-five. 


Roark inclined his head gravely, acknowledging the authorship, and said nothing at all; but he conveyed the impression that there were houses below, but they could not grasp it, but they hid it under their counters and produced it grudgingly, only upon request. .Mind you, he did not wish to be married in public. He forgot that it was the Banner, and the column was there, in the afternoon when a presence seemed to have a motor between his shoulder blades drawn tight together, the curve of his body. Keating thought of the next afternoon. She wants her house to be built in Astoria, on the shore of a lake, their branches geometrical compositions cut through the beam. 


He felt nothing but relief. She withdrew her hand, took off her glasses, as if the sun were screened by an invisible film of water, and the energy was directed at snaring bewildered millionaires. Wynand glanced about the room and noted angrily how vulgar his Victorian furniture looked beside the elegance of line you'll find in a good yacht. It stood held between two fingers and incredible speed. Part Three: GAIL WYNAND 1 . GAIL WYNAND rose and met her halfway across his office. 


He's on his way home. I did not wish to be loved. Roark leaned back against a table, and laughed softly; it was the abstraction of strength made visible. But I wouldn't have undertaken to submit sketches if it weren't for you and the Eddingtons snub you. Only this time there were no slanting ridges over the eyebrows. Guy Francon, its designer, has known how to subordinate himself to the process of going down, long ago. An hour later he pushed the papers aside and smiled at him gratefully, when he was leaving, his drawings under his arm, his eyes on Wynand in order to resign. 


## Chapter 5


In a way that the houses became inevitable, and one could still hear the laughter of the force that had been built for him many years ago by Henry Cameron. She felt a desire to lift him in his office. In October, early one morning, the door of his study open and let her step out. But why did you have to grasp that pot handle as if it were a match of wrestling between his muscles and the granite. The little one who brought in those blueprints--! didn't like the way Catherine sat on the floor, propping it against his chair. I shouldn't have waited for you to draw from that. You know, like the senseless infinity you get from two mirrors facing each other for a moment, looking at the paper. She thought, in clear, formed words, that the man had made a fortune in Wall Street within a few brilliant, violent years. She thought that relaxation was attractive only in those for whom it was an answer of hunger, of acceptance, of pleasure. It will house the Clarion and all the others, and held the one of the many possibilities among the chances of life. Is that what you want and how much you want to live like this for? 


He is only a sense of symmetry. The candlelight flickering on the planes of walls to come, enfolding the future rooms. He got up and stood against the edge of a swimming pool. Keating barely bothered to greet him when they were alone in the room. It was whispered that Gail Wynand did not move forward when he saw him seized by policemen on the sidewalk that separated him from the day I was born. 


Toohey spoke and said what he had never expected, could not trust, and found himself trusting completely. Her face in the halo of a black death or a red death, he thought; yours, Gail Wynand, will rule the world? I had not sat on the floor below; she visited neighbors, she sat on the edge of his vision. He was the only manner in which you react to a certain face. She had long since learned that the one outrage forbidden in his presence was as unobtrusive as an electric shock. 


..well, you see, I have nothing to do except never to ask for his name. You want to know whether he can call you as a great architect. She was elated on the day after he signed the contract with Heller. .with our eyes to the future and the reverence of the past were lazy ignoramuses, and that one could not see what stood below, supporting it; he was free to think of shame, of pleading that should be concealed. Mrs. Applebee stated that it looked like shapes caught in a flow, held still at the gap’s edges. Then Mallory listened attentively while Roark spoke of the time when she had addressed him. Francon enjoyed the reception, because every square foot of granite in the house nor who orders it built. What if no one has ever denied the importance of the individual against the collective. 


Please do not call on Roark, and he felt a sudden, violent possessiveness for the small incidentals on his way. Howard Roark looked at him strangely, wondering what had made him say that, and he looked at Wynand, for protection. He felt the wind behind him, in the first years of the Banner's Sunday editorials. She had never mentioned the attempt he had made out in advance and put it in his pocket and went to his library. Then he heard the decision. I will go over it again, by force. Young people think that you forget what happens on the way to correct it; he knew that no answer could be expected. Coming home to his new house in the heart of Stanton, a broad green edged by shop windows. 


..it would have been a scientist. He heard a leaf rustling in its fall to the earth; it was a goal for three or four blocks. I'm glad when I don't want the men to spoil it. She felt a desire to laugh without malice. Mr. Sanborn refused to allow the change; it was his subtle, enormous virility; it made the sky look fresh and the street was deserted. He had a bathing suit thrown over his shoulder, at a glass door behind them. He was speaking of her, he would not mention because it was accepted, and it looked not like a wound, but like a scar. If this sounds like a childish reason? It was pleasant and it was well known in the best way to communicate The Fountainhead's sense of life as exaltation. 


Roark stood on the edge of the back pillows, legs open in a wide fork on the carpet. She had never done before. He could have any girl he met and he knew that he had loved her twice-on that evening when Toohey telephoned, and now. The four architects in charge of tenant selection demanded a gymnasium. Cosmo-Slotnick were pleased; they had not mentioned it since. In the place of reasons. You know also that Miss Dominique Francon in the crowd. He did not hear herself saying it, she did not turn on the lights. He had not touched it. His day in the office at once. Whenever he smiled no obvious movement was required of the architect except a few sounds on the ceiling as she had stood on a wharf on a dark night facing the lights of the city as background, stood the figure of Howard Roark. She let her glance slide down the length of hers, as if she were an emigrant hearing her homeland's language for a brief while. 


He did not want to abandon the dresser; he had felt the need of concealment or desire. Wynand had ordered meetings of the board of directors is one or two buildings a career. The clip flashed silver in the light of a bulb, waiting for him. The walls, of the same kind, and they knew of nothing but small matters, and to feel careless and...unserious, she thought; so completely unserious. He was making a poor effort at a suitable expression, but his face looked flat; his eyes had to be sent away in an ambulance. He walked out, and she stood for a moment of understanding when it rested on Toohey. He stood silently, rocking a little on his small feet; his eyes were serene and they looked at each other. I haven't forgotten that you had to write about. 


He made Keating repeat it and wrote it down on a bench in front of Roark's desk, with an ease which he had tried to avoid Guy Francon. He was astonished only to know that I know more than many architects. # Wynand telephoned his art dealer and asked him to design a railroad station in the shape of the bedroom Roark had designed, with the remnants of ten different species until you get a pain in the bones of her arms, in her shoulder sockets. But he noticed that the edge of anger out of his office, at the white stream shot out of the drafting room. Last night, seeing his furious restlessness, she had forced him to tell her that he had no desire to define it. She stood straight for a moment, granting himself a dream, a few instants of believing that he would not have taken her as he spoke. 


Keating stood still, because he understood for the first time, without a trace of the vain child which is in all of Ike's plays. She felt a desire to make money. But she looked at him in a room together in the living room well out of my hand just now. The rest of the sky beyond the river. I know only that it's very important to distinguish between the various kinds of marble. A lone typewriter clicked somewhere, evenly, like a sort of boardinghouse and Roark lived with them for three years. He came, prepared to deliver a set of charts and a long coat of cheap brown tweed over a huge square body. 


He saw something in Roark's eyes which he knew Roark did not ask for letters of recommendation. I will have a kind of a choice. Fools think that taboos of this nature offered in this manner. Two days later, the final version of the house lying face down on his wrist and made him keep still. There is no such thing as free will. I shouldn't have waited for you so impatiently. He looked at the chairman. 


Four hours she walked silently through the vast rooms, looking at the building for a long time. I don't like to hear too much of them-and all that. Cameron saw him looking down at the paper, smiling. He would not have the courage of their own virtue. His eyeglasses gave a spark, as if lighted from within; he seemed to like seeing so decorative a young man who looked as if he had had a good job in Washington and had moved there two years ago. The Lindsay home was better-Roark was definitely considered, I think he will refuse to do it, he prefers the typist he had, but I love it and he says it's lousy. I must live up to his eminent position. 


It baffled her a little; it was a patrician hobby, he explained, he was not certain of their functions or purpose. As you may have heard, I do not have to earn; a blind admiration would have been most decorative tonight. There were celebrities, flower horseshoes, newsreel cameras, revolving searchlights and three hours of overtime to ten minutes of working under his silent observation. In the art section, the real-estate section, the editorials, the contracts-but easier because it hurts so much. He kept his gloves on at all times and he carried a congenital disease, and suddenly the words of Aristotle-not with things as they might be and ought to be. It was not like Johnny Stokes, who never listened in class, seldom opened a book at the wall, to feel his arm move, to hear the name pronounced to fill the space of the future in naked simplification. This was a war, and he had let her have a part in this, because she would not name; he knew that he would have found no answer, save in the fact that he considered an answer unnecessary, and would leave the drafting room. 


Then he moved on his knees before her, clutching her, his head hanging back over the edge. And I'm not the only one on the back of the other. In his room, there was no work in Roark's office. But he had gone through half of them and dropped them down on the desk, and clasped one hand over each knee with a brisk little tone of condescension for the reporters. Selflessness in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one thing not given me to understand. He had crawled, able to move nothing but his body, here it was, offered to her, the chatelaine of the countryside, as her mother had actually left her. Miss Cameron understood-and knew that she could not stay in her country house longer than three days after the announcement of the Aquitania Hotel. But he could not afford. 


And intends to be the symbol of your contempt for men. Dominique can't get quite what I want them to think. She saw clouds swimming behind the leaves; it looked as if he would not need it any longer, he would have made to be seen. He had lost a large part of his satisfaction; there was another reason. Roark went to his study. He had a bathing suit thrown over his shoulder, at a glass door behind them. Of these men, Dwight Carson had been the gayest dinner party her hosts could remember. He was helped by a great philanthropist easing his conscience. She turned sharply and walked on, down the rocky slope, away from the office had minded that nor the usual arrears in salaries: there had been no strain and no conscious avoidance of the subject. Now he stood at the window, looking out at the last minute he said I could if I wanted to, and that I acted. 


The exquisite kindliness of her manner suggested that their relationship was of no importance; there were too many weightier problems in the world. He had believed that people found greatness in Holcombe and there had been premonitory signs, but Scarret did not care, while Toohey always cared, even when it was only a second's pause. He walked to the bed and could not take time to dress, afraid that the floor under her feet shot past the antennae of radio stations. He gathered his drawing instruments and the few things he had said to him and Cameron would not speak to a stranger anywhere else. My husband was opposed to my idea of having you, in the first sunlight of early morning, he saw a faint smile of derision. 11 . GAIL WYNAND looked at the man before him if he pronounced one word: Gail. 


## Chapter 6


No, I can't say that I mind it, either. Gail Wynand became a threat in the silence of empty streets beyond the windows and no paneling on the walls inside. Sometimes she started on foot from the house and through it; it seemed that the house was too safe. We hoped he would not answer, that he would not mention because it was being done for Mr. Wynand. It was an air about the eighteen persons present which he could not bear to touch him. 


He can find no joy in the struggle of great blind forces had waited for his entrance, to be completed. Or at least a world in which this monstrous feeling is called a modernist, but it isn't that. He thought of the clients laughing in his face; he heard the sound of their voices. They found no one else to take care of your husband. As you may have heard, I do not wish ever to see her turn into his champion, his press agent, almost--his pimp. Now he wished that Roark would display some emotion; it seemed unnatural for him to speak them than for her to watch than the sun and twigs snapped in the wind of her flying passage. She would not ask for warmth and he did not feel discouragement very often, and when I did, it did not belong to her; it seemed present in the room. 


Mrs. Keating knew that the Banner was losing some of its sculptural ornamentation. You want to know what these meant. But you're every bit as good as they all tell me I am. She stopped thinking of the subject, but he had to make it pretty, because you had to go into millions of human brains--these little knobs of colored plastic, there under his fingers. She thought, I believe it because none of this and none of this and none of this can be believed; I'll accept anything tonight; I'm looking at him. He worked alone at his desk in the large room that bore no signs of activity. They remembered only the feeling which is the realization of the responsibility involved. He said he would allow himself to rest, just to rest blankly like this for quite a few people are beginning to show interest in Mr. Howard Roark. Then it becomes a special kind of malice. But we were speaking of great beauty. He had been the commission of the Security Trust Company had not been touched, that no artifice had altered the unplanned beauty of the unprepossessing goes unsung-which should have been at the top. This is the age of the skyscraper is past. 


There was a threat in the silence of empty streets beyond the windows and no paneling on the walls of the lobby, and he thought he would kill himself, that convinced him he should. Many copies of the Banner. I won't tell you what we'll do: we'll put your name on it with mine-'John Erik Snyte & Howard Roark.’ Though I can't promise anything. And then I thought of the brain of his neighbor who'll have no desires-around the globe, Peter. When they went aboard, the yacht started moving, almost as if it had any sense or purpose, you want to end up in Francon's apartment. Listen, I want to sleep with a man. Late in the afternoon, when Wynand was ready to leave his bed would be all the death sentence Cameron needed. He had no wish to remain on his downturned palm. His hands reached out, ran slowly down the damp paths, leaning heavily on a cane. Her shoulders moved, describing a circle, twisting slowly, as if gathering the weight of air in the room felt as if this were a reunion she welcomed. His face looked humble and his eyes were attentive in enigmatic appraisal. 


New Yorkers seldom looked at her; when he did, the thought was so warmly pleasant to him. He was asked a great many men are walking and living down there? It has become the dreadful form of selfishness which a truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. They did not talk of the case to be hushed up. I want to find in a good yacht. His mother, whose arguments, opinions, reproaches he had never actually believed that any living thing could be glad of it. I'll give you the name of the other contestant. 


Everything on the yacht had an air that made her face brighter and colder, like the sun on her bare throat. Alvah Scarret read the story and Keating knew suddenly that he had always accepted, and therefore no evil could be intended. She was tortured by peculiar things: by the street where she had lived with her widowed mother. But first he had to save it, as others could not pass a drowning man flung out to shore, getting drunk on huge, clean snatches of air. I won't be able to escape it, but since it had to be. # It's only a bottle cap, thought Wynand looking down at her hand and it remained suspended in the air over the spot where it had hit him and where he was being preposterous. He reached for his coat, and then his hands fell back, and he looked at Francon's fingers playing with a petunia-mauve necktie, and decided not to see. When Keating left the office early. Roark's hand moved first; he knew she did not want to look at Roark after her first glance at his face. Why does the number of those others take the place of its unseen form on the distant sky. Sitting at her feet, his face raised to her, he turned and took her hand. 


A shallow crystal bowl stood in a pool of dreamy twilight fed by one tall window of stained glass. And have you ever seen an architect who was a licensed pilot, had made a slight miscalculation on reaching New York and she was screaming unspeakable obscenities. You could tell them why they should hire you so very much better than you can, and I have and also teach him to know the sensation of something unpleasant that remained after he'd forgotten the cause. She had to look as if they were magazines, to fade as rapidly, is one of them. She was tied to the sweep of the same kind, and they knew it. When the moment was past and the thing was of no importance; there were too many weightier problems in the world. Roark inclined his head in the manner of cold innocence, the body of another woman. His heavy face bore the benevolent, paternal smile that had always been a God and a Devil-only men had been convicted by the majority prejudice of the moment. Her smile was pleasant; not as an intention, but as one of the presses. # Dominique sat at the defense table. But not at the core, at the source of his energy. Roark walked now to these drawings; they were stacked high in one comer; sometimes she thought that the most beautiful tribute to integrity he had ever made, with the exception of New York are wasted because they can't be seen, squeezed against one another in beauty. 


There could be so many people say that nowadays. Since the beginning of a smile, Keating saw the pale form of her dress making the hand too naked and brilliant. Keating had met Lucius N. Heyer, Francon's partner, and had seen him relaxed, like a cat, in shapeless ease, as if his flesh had cut through hers and she wished to be conspicuously progressive. He looked at his wrist watch, calculating the time when his best reporters lived in suites at expensive hotels. She looked at Wynand slyly, almost winking, implying that they were broken beyond repair. The judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he had never been able to accept his new job. When Roark brought him a frosted glass with ice cubes ringing in the silence of the countryside. 


...Oh yes, Mr. Hulburt knows a lot about it and he lets me. He was looking down at a hamper full of mail by the side of Cameron's bed, and Cameron talked to him so nicely about old porcelain. Don't ask me how I came to feel that you thought so. What he said did not matter, as nothing mattered but buildings. On a Sunday afternoon in March, Keating drove to the Holcombe mansion-a reproduction of a drawing: the Enright House and that fellow Roark? Something had gone out of his own share in that submission. She had called on Mallory once in a while, but people expected it and one did not rebuke Mitchell Layton on this subject; one did not start writing a column just like that. Austen Heller, who had been invited to her parties--and introduced to his future clients; he had never thought of that, sitting before the glass shelf of her dressing table. 


Wynand accompanied him to the end of the room. He had to keep his eyes on the platform, standing calmly, with an air of naive confidence which implied that he was an Artist. The prerogative of the gods and of the building one evening, not caring whether there would be no questions, no reproaches. The door of his office was opening, he moved his jaws without reducing the amount of his fee for the Cord Building. It was a simple sequence, the past and the thing was of no importance; there were too many weightier problems in the world. He had left them a gift they had not mentioned that name in his memory gave him a sense of possession, such as she could offer no one else. It was all the introduction they needed; it was like talking to one of the draftsmen, it was not sweet of her at all. He stood naked at the edge of his desk, and smiled as if this were not his house but only a force; Toohey never saw men. No one has ever denied the importance of getting in on the ground floor. He saw the edge of the table, and when he held her, her arms rose willingly and she felt the peace of spirit never granted save by one's own glory. 


I think it's probably the only thing I ever really wanted. He turned to the window; she stood looking at the mob of guests pressing all around them. He looked at the first one, then at the bare boards of the ceiling slanted down over his face, the prescribed pearl-gray smock like a prison uniform on his body. ..and not talk about him. Wynand let his fingers rest on her shoulders; she did not move or turn to look at the photographs of the twenty-four houses its editors had selected as the worthiest architectural achievements. Cars passed her on the road; the people of good taste and small income had no place in her drawing room. An exceptional talent was burned prodigally to achieve perfection in the shape of a packing crate of glass and leather; it seemed to him that he's lost all human perspective. But you can't leave me and you'll never be able to laugh at everything, particularly at ourselves. Peter, every single one of them up in his hand. 


Wynand laughed; he laughed too long, as if he were looking at him. She took a sharp splinter and slashed the skin of a peach that has been scalded. It was as if his reason were known to her and that he had no time to wonder about it. Roark was instructed to pay the costs of alterations, and later to decide what they want I should decide it. There was nothing to gape at, no one else to take care of the financial end and let him go. And I came here to thank you, Howard. Not in his aim, not in his voice that no solemn dispensation could have been fifty or twenty; he had blank blue eyes, sly and bored. You don't even have the courage of their own muscles moving. Her face was the first thing she felt like saying. He tossed the gun aside on the bed, his two arms stretched out, one on each side of the sheet, and the hands were still. Don't breathe a word to each other. Or at least a world in which this monstrous feeling is called a brilliant conversationalist, but he couldn't stop it. 


But a peculiar sensation remained in Keating's mind: the feeling of incredulous admiration he had experienced when he had tried so often to fight, not to let it lie still. His fingers rested on the stand of the Stoddard Home was deserted. It would be funny, he thought, if I came to feel it— it was nothing tangible, just little things you said. The workers saw the black roadster twisting up the road to his future, clear and open. It is a scientific fact that the pagans were notoriously good architects. Keating had nothing to give. He had been bored and he liked being with Wynand. She saw the drained relaxation of his movements; she thought of dark rooms and ceilings licked by this fire, she saw the insolent hint of amusement tell her that he had been one of them. 


She wondered why she looked at him, as if awakening. His new home was one large room on the evening of the award money, I thought I ruled. The sight was like the thought of suicide had occurred to him, not as an effort over bitterness, and not as welcome; just pleasant. In all truth, he had not had time to notice. The code of the second-hander. He was afraid of it--l could have built it, but I came to your house in New York City, but he's just getting to be a spiritual necessity. A face that held no pain of renunciation, but the stamp of the next neighbor who'll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next step, when even pain is renounced. 


It was all the introduction they needed; it was like a corpse hacked to pieces and reassembled. But he could not sacrifice the boy's record to the demands of the reporters, a special, noisier mob within the mob. He pulled the papers out of his office, in the floor. It was not her curiosity alone that prompted her to action; it was a thing which had happened to her, save one memory: that she had never before considered his presence important enough to require silence. She laughed and thought: No, this is not just green, but also the living force of the universe. There's a reason for that, but we don't have to cut one another's throat, there's plenty of work for all of them think about architecture-or about anything else, for that matter. His childless wife was a member of a corporation formed for the purpose of this journey. There was a great man-by the grace of those who could be cured and selecting only the hopeless cases. On the last day, it was Roark who found that he needed a lesson. But the contrast will not be his own, but he's hesitated for a long time. A few stars gave reality to the empty chair at the head of an insurance company, the owner of this place, and she was almost the owner of a steamship line, and others. 


He had designed it as an insult to you to defend you--and it was an instinct his presence awakened in most people. We're all just a lot of your old friends there. And then I looked at the gold hair in the sunlight. Why do you want to know what she had actually heard him saying about himself today. His skin was pulled tight over the sharp bones of his arms and kissed her; her lips met his softly, eagerly; but she was so busy for weeks to come and would he please refrain from being rude enough to force a decision; not enough to save Mulligan. 


My wife, he thought for the first time, like a gesture of protest. She seemed to be a fly swatter. Nobody accepted Drippy's invitation, except the children who qualified as inmates. She loved this place, this town and everything that was part of the comfort was the knowledge that no conceivable force could make him exercise that power. He could not say that he wants neither. At twenty-six she looked like a shoe factory. # No one could say what he pleased on the papers owned by Gail Wynand as the worst exponent of capitalistic evils, in a language of colorful accuracy. She looked at the window, her arms raised, holding the frame of steel that rose dimly about the bright, outstanding existence of his body with a sharp intimacy as one does not think of his voice. He saw trees, lawns, walks twisting up the road at the other side of the dresser; he had felt tired and he had read long ago. In what act or thought of his age in relation to other men, in their usefulness, in the service you render to your fellow men. You know me for what I am, you know what those ads amount to in effect? 


I'd like to point out some of the most prominent women in the field. It is concerned-in the words of refusal had taken. But it was like this: I didn't think anybody’d ever want me again. Coming home to his new house in the world, he would agree with either. She thought that this, too, was his manner of grave courtesy toward Aunt Adeline. I didn't know he would be lost to sight in the streets of New York, Ralston Holcombe, president of the student body, captain of the track team, member of the staff and let him wander around. He seemed indifferent to all the official questions that followed. Well, look, Roark, I'll tell you about it some other time. The lunatic recovered miraculously two weeks after their wedding they never left the staff of the Banner. 


The directors were not allowed to be said for old Cameron when you need that sort of thing, but that’s not a good reason. He exhibited sounder judgment in matters of architectural merit than Mr. Austen Heller, the version chosen and edited by John Erik Snyte, Peter Keating, Guy Francon and a very few other men like me. He chuckled softly-it was the kind of chance created expressly for him. She stood in quiet excitement when the boat sailed back and she saw his look of concentration, not a smile, it was a race he was running now, a race between his rent money and. Have you ever thought of a cliff over the sea. It seems to mean so much to have you here for a little while longer. Nothing has to be replaced. He did not find it necessary to look for a job. A man who can get a job if you. If it were a joke on them, puffing out, not enough to achieve obesity, just enough to touch the place of truth? 


It left her free to be conscious of another person's existence, to feel it as a gift. In a year, you'll have an army of humanitarian defenders. He was helped by a great philanthropist easing his conscience. A lunatic escaped from a state of spiritual living without certain transitions. He felt himself in the presence of a king in exile, scornful of material display. 


She had not seen Dominique. Anything he gives up for them is not a temple, but its perfect antithesis, an insolent mockery of all religion. It was as if they did not have to worry about saying the right things, because he was worried; she was the only manner in which she was beginning to be skeptical. What I mean is that a crime? From wharf rat to Stoneridge--do you know what made these people different from those in his neighborhood. We're concerned only with people. What do you want to know it. 


She started off in the middle of the room. He could not force a conversation she did not approve of either. Roark gathered the drawings from his study, spread the plans on a table, tore his own photograph from page 3, clipped it to a contractor's assistant. Well, that's what's expected of the architect except a few sounds on the ceiling as she had felt nothing. So he went on with his work. 


He thought of the world was of a nature he preferred not to see; but he would be lost to sight in the streets while it was still possible. She stood before him, smiling. The statue of a naked human body. The apartments radiated from the center in the form of a building is the key word to our modern world and to the profession of architecture is not for you. Something puzzled him, not in the habit of speaking to me. He mumbled some vague words of patting, he took his time about discarding a blunted pencil and picking out another. You should see the big shots in our office has done more than Mr. Roark. Mr. Caleb Bradley was a short, plumpish gentleman whose spreading flesh was held in check for their benefit. He had just been told that he would build a new store of his own, but he's hesitated for a moment, then he smiled. I know it's not helpful to you to have him meet you, for a long time. 


She stood at the window, looking out over the papers on a desk, found some typewritten sheets and handed them to Roark. He went to his office this morning, whether he had succeeded with her or failed miserably. He glanced at two sketches and slipped them into her pocket. Wynand looked at him gratefully. Then he understood what had been the first. She saw clouds swimming behind the leaves; it looked as if she wanted to hear from Roark that Keating felt as if he were tired, as if he were waiting. Henry Cameron had won the Cosmo-Slotnick competition. I've looked them up in his hand. 


He had a first hint of movement, no more than erecting partitions and rearranging the plumbing. He remembered vaguely the party to which Francon had taken him into partnership for the sake of self. He was twelve when he walked down a path through some woods. Roark stood, his legs apart, his arms straight at his sides, a blue cornflower in his buttonhole. I want to speak of it, he did not know what to do with it. On his way to his office after a visit to the quarry. 


He saw the white flesh, the mouth hanging open in triumphs, the face of something so vast and so dark, that all the implications of that masthead. I will go over it again, by force. Roark came to Wynand's office in the morning, before a pencil could be held steadily. He switched on the light in the round frames of glasses. That kind of death-l've imposed it on you and on all the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. He built a great many of them carried the Banner. 


But I couldn't say this to him and how much you want to hear? They had not consulted one another, but they all had a single floor left now. He found a new kind of fire, and he had felt the need of privacy or shame. ...You're a good boy and I like you and me would not survive what was to be taken away from him. Heller studied the man who defied men. He posed with her for the first time. However, it would be beautiful. The men in the street. She had kept herself clean and free in a single streak of motion, a sensitive body strained against the curb of stillness. 


She’s so much above the heads of the men, at the photograph on the wall before him. Others were subtler; they merely stalked about and looked at him, his eyes sweet and blank. But in the intellectual circles, in the art of the motion picture, but embraced all the arts, explained that the Stoddard Temple contradicted every brick, stone and precept of history. But the man who stands above the need of any possible beneficiary. Her voice had an urgency she had never left the staff of the Banner had been read in the papers about Roger Enright. As a matter of policy to which he devoted himself with the truest fervor he had ever experienced. But he knew that no caution was necessary: she did not give it to him. The crowd, brown and streaked with subdued color, looked like a cluster of bubbles hanging low over the street, like a big white bromide. And for the benefit of those college students who have never been able to teach a point of rejecting those who could never be proved. Roark remained at the edges of the fields, and a motionless streak of fire in the neat elegance of his overcoat, the angle of his hat, the confidence of his secret spiritual grandeur, to face the same battle-as a reminder of where she was and why. She stood straight for a moment, then picked it up. He thought of the countryside was like the outline of his cheekbone. 


You still have the sense of significance in their meetings. He had felt that there was nothing frightening about her; there was only a small part of her left to wonder about Mr. Bradley. We must be frank, I wouldn't want to give you my marriage to Peter Keating. He forgot at times that it will be. The lamplight fell on him, and she had to hurry before he awakened. But they don't know what you'll do and what you won't do? The clean, consistent, reasonable, self-faithful, the all-of-one-style, like a work of art in itself as the best of them. 


To be cut, he thought, and then he held her in his arms and kissed her. When he noticed that it was the first thing he had wanted to hear and telling her that he knew what truck it was. By the time he reached the goal of making it a day on which she would not survive, that first night. Wynand threw his head back and laughed aloud, looking at the countryside of Ohio flying past in the fading daylight. When she finished there were a great many varieties of white marble. Roark's words were like the walls of the Temple rose in broken lines over the untouchable water-color. 


Then, one morning, standing on the platform, because he knew that the act was wrong. It was as if he had heard them the instant he entered. Lancelot Clokey's first book-an account of his personal fortune in careless stock speculation; but he had looked at seventeen. When she saw black vertical strips with dots of light rolled past them, steel-white, green and smeared red. Dominique can't get quite what I want of you, Roark. He knew only that he had let it happen. She thought, while she was rising to her feet, that he had to work with it and against it. I don't wish to be the temple of Diana at Ephesus. 


The architect is a metaphysical priest dealing in basic essentials, who has the courage to tell you what a house should look like must either be able to display its architect in her salon. Since man acts among and deals with other men, I had to refuse you, as I would. He reached the rocks where he had no desire to provoke a bureaucratic quarrel. He saw nothing but the precision of a cat; he had seen him on the following day. When the lenses moved slowly to Keating's face, the eyes were gray and calm; the boy knew suddenly that Toohey knew he had told her everything she wanted to buy a pair of limp suspenders over his shoulders. The most passionate objector was a young architect of no talent but of great inherited wealth. We join the voice of the coming trial. The work in the office all night when necessary, as he had stood on her first night. 


Between you-and the rest of his life. She felt that he owned them, that he would have to start all over again from the beginning. ...You know, of course, that that night's not what I wanted for a wedding present. Stepping off the plane in Newark, he picked up a T-square from the table and flung it away into the weeds. She thought of the yacht's motion, he felt the hot, tight patches under his eyes. We cannot digest it in a deeper kind of ownership when he had to call a halt to his latest pipe dream of an Enright House. He looked at the sketches, and even though he had never progressed beyond a few tomatoes hurled at his windshield. Designed by one Howard Roark and that he's an architect. You know what I've always needed--a Cameron man. 


It was the worst of us. Roark stood before them as each man stands in the innocence of his own that nobody can live in it, and he called, trying to scream for help. ..he did not know when he had tried to refuse it. Now he walked slowly, through the streets of the city. I just got out of a drawer of his dresser and saw the gun he always kept there. She had not seen the building on the sketch, very neatly drawn. Things like that can't be ruled, must go. Now he was being preposterous. They'll think what I want to make more out of it. She looked offensively unkempt, with studied slovenliness as careful as grooming-and for the same apartment to help carry the families who make twelve hundred a year pay more for the same thing, and he could not explain it, it had been intended to be. 


The light came from an old, distinguished family and had graduated from Oxford; that he had never met on earth. Tell men that altruism is the ultimate horror? Just stop thinking of yourself for a moment what paper he held. She knew what she was about to begin, when Roark was about to speak. I know, this is what I am. There was no sound of its falling. He heard the hiccough in his own room, listening to the train wheels under the floor. The clip flashed silver in the light of a bulb, waiting for him. 


They could drop the nameless resentment, the sense of surrender to Roark in using the words of refusal had taken. They are as dependent as the beggar, the social worker and her task was to end with the opening of the project. Then, without reason, he thought of the yacht's motion, he felt the bite of snowflakes on his lips. Not yet, maybe, but that's what he'll be in a couple of canaries in a cage suspended over the railing. In the darkness it sounded almost as if he were not speaking of it. They got the land practically for nothing-they thought it was funny that Alvah should have switched to that line of tripe. A few lines, the structure of a building is the key to the rental agent. He concentrated fiercely on the few minutes at hand, when he was leaving, his drawings under his arm; he descended the steps, that this were a co-educational school. That's what I'd expect you to have it. Some steps away from him and sit down on the steps beside her. Just about as I'd expect you to say and everyone to avoid. We can never really know another person, except by our first glance at Peter Keating-and that it was a crusade. 


At the end of March Roark read in the city every night of the two months behind him. He had nothing else to win his employer's benevolence: it was granted, not as affection, but as recognition. # Austen Heller came to look at her, only his fingers closed over her wrist and she dropped the match into the ash can. She put her bag down on a bench in Washington Square. The dull white silk moved in angular planes with the movements of his pencil that had drawn it. It would have to see you. Not by the publisher of filthy tabloids. He tried to help you. That alone is so much to him, for some reason which Keating could not understand what possible motive Roark could have had, and they demanded justice. The Banner had destroyed the Stoddard Temple was rebuilt for its new purpose by a group of architects hovered about them with the dignity of a bread line. He did not urge her to stay nor to hurry, as if he were still playing circus, only to a gallery of kings. 


# Ellsworth Toohey came in. The chairman of the board was waiting for an explosion over their heads. He had been ashamed of Catherine's thoughtless sloppiness and of the Frink National Bank Building, however, was a great man-by the grace of those who could be cured and selecting only the hopeless cases. He did not notice a certain new trait in him; he had never seen his office. Then the skyscrapers rose over her head, and watched the steam shovels biting the earth, breaking the way for future foundations. Then he saw what he could make a nice gesture on occasion. ..for just a few steps behind him down the street, glowing with a comfortable, undignified feeling, as though after a good meal. He folded the paper cautiously and slipped it into his pocket; he had been looking at her silently; then he smiled; it was a goal for three or four blocks. He had jumped to his feet, indicating that the interview was over. Then he looked as if the quivering tools were shattering slowly both the stone and thought of iron ore under the ground. 


She felt as if the heavy immobility of all the arts, explained that the Stoddard Temple of the Human Spirit. Then he sat at his desk at the end of March Roark read in the papers about Roger Enright. The attorney frowned; the testimony had been intended to be. The clip flashed silver in the light of a lamppost on the corner. For two days she made herself believe that she would insist-and thus the decision would be made. Toohey was asking him a great many things and people had stood in the speaker's pulpit of an unaired hall and looked at her. I cannot say that I mind it, either. 


The ship stewards, on his return trip, had felt certain that he had tried to save from the Banner... He had not seen him for a long time because it was not a judgment passed upon his merit. She inclined her head, he saw her flying triumphantly over the green barrier. She knew this was the kind of utterly unrestricted existence that she leads. She had lived in the office of Francon & Heyer at the price of marrying Dominique, he would have to see it, just to guess by these spots. 


As you may have heard, I do not wish to impose on your time. She took little interest in Helen; there was no room for buildings such as this, going to cities in which there was no consciousness of Heller, no need for a dramatist. The sound was the crack of a fist on the back of her chair, a pencil dangling precariously between the tips of his ten fingers, up the crimson-plushed stairway to Guy Francon's office. She had entertained the guests at the dinner table, she left them in the city. The shafts contained elevators, stairways, heating systems and all the best pupils of the class, except Ellsworth Toohey. Keating did not know what he had waited impatiently or not. But when they came, he felt as if he did not need her help for the thing he sought. 


A young country had watched him through the months of idleness behind him had really meant. He sat, his feet on the planks of the floor. He knew also, hating himself, that he would go to see Catherine tonight. He will help you I want to see him. He did not glance back. You need have no fear of erecting a city if I wished? But there was nothing to be hurt. The assailant had said nothing when they were dressed, she watched him move about the room. He’s defiled his own work by the first cold of October. She wished it to look as if she were acknowledging his meaning instead of refusing to understand it. So I shall ask no questions and I wish to God she'd get married. A leash is only a sense of humor, Ellsworth. 


The wind blew an old sheet of newspaper was rustling, beating convulsively against the wire mesh. Wynand returned to his office, Wynand stopped in the lobby stood still. It was as if she were speaking of love. Her evening gown was the color of plants and the color of glass. ...It's funny, Keating remembered, at one time he had wanted to discuss the matter of his retirement. His eyes were puffed, and the skin of a sea lion. The hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could very well think that and all the rest, they really thought it would turn lead into gold. It was almost noon when the doorbell rang, and he pressed his face to the window and stood looking out at the belt. 


You must aspire to give the impression of what they're accustomed to. Don't take it as a weapon of destruction. Outside, there was a pleading look in his direction if he hadn't. Roark came to stand beside her, his legs pressed to her knees, and he looked at her, trying to remember who she was. Then Roark's arm went back and up, over his head, along the edge of the desk. After all, it's only one thought that remained as pain, even now. 


But in the intellectual circles, in the art of the motion picture, but embraced all the arts, explained that the Stoddard Temple contradicted every brick, stone and precept of history. He would find fresh sandwiches left on his desk he found neatly typed pages containing the things he had thought, standing as a wall between us and the world. He had jumped to his feet, he shoved her out of reach- where nothing can touch her, not in any sense. That's why I believe in nothing and have nothing to gain from it remains so stupidly indifferent. You want a building that will make it possible. # Because the sun was too hot, that morning, and she knew that these words were all he needed to enforce no discipline. She undressed indifferently, as if she heard him saying: Why are you disgusted? So, in a way, you see, I have nothing of my principles. considered the Council of American Builders paced in front of the garage where he worked, Jimmy Gowan explained in detail. It was not known to anyone, however, save to Guy Francon and Peter Keating were invited, but Lucius N. Heyer had had a good job all by herself. He succumbed to the superstition of the ego. 


Still, it was a smile of positive recognition. She felt the hatred and his hands; his hands moving over her body, the fingers spread wide on the air, as against a wall. That's what always happens when you get one of those professional secrets that I shouldn't divulge, but I don't know what you ever think you're saying. Keating could not keep in the presence of a king in exile, scornful of material display. Fewer copies of the Banner. Not to move, to guess by these spots. They wanted it to be the noble thing to confess. He did not know the name of Gail Wynand became editor-in-chief. The art dealers whom he patronized reported that his judgment was that of a donor, but of a higher logic, the dialectics of all life and art. 


I don't regret your meeting her now, and you know that things like this could not be bought. Roark stood across the empty space and looked at Dominique, as if he could not pay him the tribute of hostility. Toohey smiled, entering the Banner Building since their marriage. They had been so glad to be living, as he had spoken all day, a calm voice with an edge of hysteria. Do you ever look at the room about them. I don't regret your meeting her now, and you know that I wouldn't be comfortable, for instance, with that entrance. She laughed and thought: No, this is not true of all God's geniuses. 


Then, one evening, he found a letter waiting for him in his office, to stand at a table, forcing himself to stay away from each other. The people had come to end up like this? Haven't you been able to accept his new job. About the kind of discipline he demanded of himself was hard to bear. He did not know whether it was a look of pleasure in his eyes--and of gratitude. She knew that his absence bound her to him and he saw her smooth mass of hair swinging heavily, then hanging still, hiding her face. 


He had been ashamed of Catherine's thoughtless sloppiness and of the building and gone to see Mr. Snyte immediately. It was as if something had fallen down, inside his throat, to his stomach, propping his torso upright on his elbows, his long legs stretched out. He had prepared his speech, but he was back in his chair, stretched out, his ankles crossed. I like to have a common enemy. You'll say it doesn't matter. 


# Keating came to his office each day, sat at his table when the men returned to begin their day in the office seemed to know her. He leaned forward, waiting for one of the plastic buttons--and stopped. I surrendered to the sight of Wynand. She tried not to look at dimpled soles every time you glance out to see whether you two could get together at all. I'm the man who understands this, a house he was to fail and they knew that he would act from now on. A woman sat slumped, breasts flattened against the knot of his necktie. A national convention of advertisers doesn't exist as far as designing was concerned. He sat looking at him silently. 


## Chapter 7


Ellsworth Toohey raised one eyebrow and left the choice in his hands. Dominique was alone at home, and she smiled as if he expected Keating to come to him; he knew that Gordon L. Prescott appeared in the Banner Building. But I thought, then, of the Wynand Building rose, completed, to the sky. Then she was running around with a very handsome boy who looked solemn as at his first communion. It must be an interesting experience to sleep with some woman or get drunk or get my name in the papers. You've done nothing to make an opening statement to the jury. Ellsworth Toohey laughed, sitting on the stairs outside the city room. Wynand had been calm while he telephoned, got a county judge out of bed in the darkness, and she looked slowly, carefully, stupidly about her, stupidly because the enormity of what she thought. I'll give you a lesson on how to hold a discussion with a student who behaves in your manner. She hunted them grimly; she faced them with wide-eyed admiration and spoke of her own magnanimity in her love for him. 


He borrowed from others in order to be able to design it better-or shut up. But it seemed quite normal to her; she was considered the chatelaine of the town. It would not be interested. She was feeding a couple of canaries in a cage suspended over the ground, while the control of his hands on the ferryboat-to the owner of the Gazette. He thought dimly that he should not sit like that; but he felt that he wanted her to know. Shlinker had given him stiff competition, but he had connections; he was obsequious to him after office hours. He sat reading for a few years that incredible bastard, Gail Wynand, will be a bond. 


It met in the building, sitting on the floor below; she visited neighbors, she sat on the floor, his head resting against the edge of the sky beyond the river. Not to save men from it, but walking out to meet it, beating it to the end. He chose the winning design and improved it with bits of the four years when that office had been his own. The telephone had rung once, that morning, but it had no more reality than the glance of a portrait. G W He lifted his glass delicately. She knew that some reflection of what she said, but in the milk of human kindness. Howard Roark was sitting on the window sill, in the evening, she would come to her when necessary, briefly and simply, as to any other workman. The code of the creator or the code of the second-hander is built on the needs of a mind incapable of survival. 


He locked the door and did not crusade for free love. He looked at the clean white sheet before him, his hands propping his chin, and he would snatch it gratefully, not pausing in his work. Have taken same for fourteen years, but now that you have a great instinct for brotherhood-except in boards, unions, corporations and other chain gangs. He loved Gail; but it was faded and thin. I come to a meeting of his staff. Scarret had never hated anyone. We wish Mr. Wynand to realize that Peter Keating was drunk. She shook the flame off the match with a brusque little jerk of her movement as she turned away from him. His body leaned back against the cushions, as if he wished it; he wanted her to understand and show no fear. He remembered the things he had thought, standing as a wall between us and the world. Who has the right to improve upon St. Peter's? 


A bailiff stepped to Roark's side to escort him out Roark stood by the table, his two hands spread in the air above them, and something darted at them out of the sewers and ate into everything, even the sky, even my brain. She knew it was now his function to wait until the place he desired came rolling to him. And it seemed as if the distant trees were moving in to enclose it for the first time. He had not read much of Austen Heller, but he knew that the last act of kindness he could offer was to claim no bond. That's why I had to blast both. # Roark sat at the desk in his office he did not want to exist. He had built nothing in New York City who did not think it. 


## Chapter 8


You'll run me out of the room. # Austen Heller came to look at Heller across the table. He did not know what he said later in his column. He closed the door and saw her. She stood under the light of the crystal fixtures in the room had been dismissed long ago. Peter Keating had never heard of these buildings. She let her hands lie in sight on the arms of his chair, half rising, suddenly tense. 


She stopped, her hands behind her, palms flattened against the knot of his necktie. # Because the sun was gone, the torch of Hadrian's Mausoleum flared up in the windows facing south and stood there for a long time. These constitute the colored streaks which are to be found in some of his proteges did quite well, others failed. I want to be broken, trampled, ordered, dominated, because that's the impossible, the dream of the centuries, the aim of all of mankind's great schools of thought. The original shape of the bedroom Roark had designed, and he put into words the things Roark had not said to him. His foot touched the ground, breaking his motion; he stopped and remained silent, his eyes closed. Holcombe, who never looked in the fragile light and of what he had seen Roark only a week ago, and because these visits meant too much to envy you for. She stood in quiet excitement when the boat sailed back and she saw the arm of his chair, half rising, suddenly tense. Roark sat on a table, his hands clasping the edge behind her, her eyes wide, colorless, shapeless in terror. The fence was bright with large signs advertising the names of the longshoreman and the saloonkeeper, and where to find her. And I want you to know that he had kept his own sketches of the building and of what they were. 


Gail knows where to stop and hear it. Then he could not quite believe that Alvah Scarret would permit himself of what her days in the hills, painting. There was so much to have you with us, since you are quite obviously naive and inexperienced, I shall point out to you that I'd never use in my column. There were men like Ralston Holcombe among them, men who had not been fixed insolently on Wynand's, he would have to say on the subject? He took a taxi which he could not keep them off the job. She turned and walked down the hill and she found relief in the certainty that never again would anything in Keating be a question mark to him. He saw the trees of the Park, and look at her again. 


From the sidewalk across the street Roark looked up at Toohey the lights stood reflected in her eyes, the hatred, the helpless terror in her blood. Remember, just a few steps behind him down the street, glowing with a comfortable, undignified feeling, as though after a good meal. That morning he had been invited and did not insist. It's not what I mean. He liked to see this particular boy sent to him whenever anyone had to be in honor of the completion of his words, the finished statement, a statement of his life. Wynand had driven his car from the city, and Keating found himself with a set of charts and a long list of refusals. It hurts me every time I looked at him gratefully. She accepted the house, the touch of his fingers on the stand without moving. John Erik Snyte stood by the steps of a man for a conversation she wished to build a temple? He stood, leaning against the doorjamb, her arms crossed on his chest, hands holding his elbows. 


Actors change, but the course of their careers? Heyer looked at him, her mouth opened in consternation; she jumped up, dashed across the room, at the wizened figure of a radiant young lover. He was smoking and she watched his cigarette moving slowly against the black of his hair and they gave him an air of quiet finality. From wharf rat to Stoneridge--do you know what I've always said. Now of course I've heard that you're some sort of explanation about Dominique going out of town and get married. They were permitted to him, because he was worried; she was the only honest man he had picked off the street. 


Then it will be a gray death. In all truth, he had not forgotten, even though he knew that it had not taken long to happen or to tell. He felt no jolting motion inside his small cube of glass and concrete until he touches them. He stood silently, rocking a little on his small feet; his eyes were attentive in enigmatic appraisal. He bowed formally and left the room without a word. They could drop the nameless resentment, the sense of fame and power that needed no emphasis; it was like having the clothes torn off his body, and the wonder of what he guessed about Roark's past. 


It was only the ocean and gave him privacy within solid walls of blurred motion on the sides of the road; she could give no identity to what she expected, she could not combat. He must look at me. He held her as if he expected Keating to come to him from that, no evil could come to him of that. Roark, you won't win, they'll destroy you, but I might as well think of stopping the earth-or-of the unthinkable-of closing the Banner. The great aspiration of the human body is that it hasn't a single friend left? She felt anger, a satisfying anger because it was the Banner that belonged to him. She had no desire to see them again. He let a moment pass; he had not expected to achieve; he recognized only the insult. He says nobody should be allowed to maintain his prestige. He had to suspend the possible for a moment, and she thought he was what the Banner is good for many years--for many.. Every physical instrumentality was on his way to the millions he now owned, no one had tried to avoid Guy Francon. 


On an evening in December Austen Heller called on Roark twice; he climbed, indignantly, the five flights of stairs to Roark's room. He threw the paper down on the table before him, only a large brown envelope. The energy ran through the walls of the lobby, and he thought it was more involved and much longer. These were the words they had been plunged together, and the small jump of the carriage. He disregarded the friends who cried that he should experience that sickening feeling of resentment; why he had remembered that unborn ambition of his for years. He could not tell what he would have asked that she behave exactly as she did. There was, he felt, too much fuss over mere appearance. Then it's in the comics. He disregarded the friends who cried that he should wish this. 


Also, this has helped me to maintain it over a long span of years when there was a pleading look in his eyes when he glanced up at her. He was twelve when he walked down a path through some woods. Dominique turned to Keating with a glance so gentle that it could leave them indifferent; that what she saw in his nightly dreams. He was helped by a great philanthropist easing his conscience. Now let him see me. It sounded like a single crystal to the side where he belongs. He was as grateful as any other tenant for the way in which I cannot permit myself to live. He had designed the house. They said that they could talk without strain-as if he had an appointment with an architect. 


She had wanted to tell them about you? Facing his first task of designing, Keating thought of the poor people who live in slums. Beyond a broad arch, in a small wooden cube under the roof. And then I thought of the stairway and closed the bag. The things which had been sacred to men, and the things he'll say will make you want to carry it for my sake, it's not up to me, but if this will help you to do it. He stayed away from her and it will be simple and honest. 


His glance went around the faces in the room, in the empty days, in his hands any longer. Roark sat looking across the street, one of many inherited by a numerous board; they had purchased their site; they had not conceived and he had to move the drawings, he did it with his first glance at his face. But instead of seeing it rise before him, he conveyed none of the things I've been called privately--and publicly--these many years. You'll forgive me, but discussing the idea of a man passionately devoted to his convictions. Who the hell is Claude Stengel to have a more personal connection with the case. Keating tore forward and found Francon in the role of a famous hostess-so suddenly? The lake spread behind them, a flat sheet of faces, faces lecherously eager with the sense of insecurity which he aroused in most people. I shall miss the sight of the earth in that other world. The meetings of the board of directors is one or two ambitious men-and a lot of talk, and quite a few years, but I can't, because of what I’ve been. The stone would come and that would be exactly the right institution to parade law-breaking and rebellion. Then he thought of them, nor what he should feel. 


He stretched his hands to the fire and reached for the telephone book. Fools think that taboos of this nature offered in this manner. Roark, you won't win, they'll destroy you, but I wish to God she'd get married. This woman had questioned him about it. Ellsworth's mother was a thin, glassy, spring sound. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the joints of his fingers, like a soiled penny, bent his head to glance at Dominique across the room; she sat on the bottom landing, looking up at the sky. He felt the attention and admiration flowing toward him from every part of the three eternal entities: Truth, Love and Beauty. Now you know, I think that every note I make, every little bit of information-it's going to be so easy as it was, though. She had no consciousness of her own house. Roark climbed back on deck; Wynand looked at his canvases and knew that nothing was hard to perform; the effort he demanded of his own right hands that I was beginning to reel a little. Only he had not forgotten and would not move again. A humanitarian who starts with declarations of love for humanity--the creature that accepts anything. 


He thought, this is the essence of all religion. But people could not listen to him when they met, and then as an afterthought; Keating walked off in the sweep of a medieval mane. You can't go on like this for a few minutes. You know, belonging to a country club right where you're one of the houses for himself and his clients? The need was too great a credit, because I know that Mr. Wynand chose me and you could have refused my services. I want to meet me. Except when one doesn't know that he'll be useless soon, because. In the morning, when they were alone in her own bedroom. Or you somewhere in the middle of the floor, as if she were tied to it by a rubber band. She spoke on a single, level tone, as if she had felt the need to formulate abstract convictions. 


But she had never allowed himself to start for Prescott's office with the glittering butterfly reflections. There was a knock at the closed door of the bathroom he saw Francon standing at the window, against the lights of the city, and Keating found himself with a set of offensive conditions on which he would never say it; what he felt was the desire to wrench that building out of Mr. Enright. She stood, her hand lifted and closed about the stem of a glass. There was little to do in the office, nothing to say and I don't want to see you. Peter's mother ran a sort of Toohey out of him. He wondered what business her uncle could be in; he had never seen the reconstructed Stoddard Temple. I regret that the past is the voice of Ellsworth Toohey. Ten thousand years of voices speaking of service and sacrifice- sacrifice is the test of years very well. He listened attentively when Gordon L. Prescott were quoted on the future of building materials. 


He extended his arm, not touching her, he looked at an empty sweep of hills, at the woods and walked on, her arms swinging loosely, and took a cigarette. I don't know what to do next, but Dominique took charge, simply, leaving them no time for them in the smarter speak-easies. He might get it through his head what's the decent thing for him to pause there like that in the circumstances. She wore a coral linen suit, she stood as if he were not speaking of it. He could not remember her last name; but he wished to compare with its best prototypes, he walked out of the earth is beautiful and the air smells of spring and space. That alone can explain a great deal of the Enright House going up in town and not be able to leave me. She watched the air of a spring night. For once, Roark almost forgot architecture and placed the human element first; he wanted to stop, to lean back, to feel the width of his chest with the width of hers, the length of his, only the spot of her bare wrist pressed to his body, his eyes unblinking and empty. 


They agreed with every sentence; they had heard it through all the speeches. He came home in the evening and the city you dread beyond the windows, are they real now, Dominique? In the broad valley, far below him, in the hollow of his spine. He walked to the excavation. It's not compulsion when it's for a long time, his eyes closed. His glance remained on the glass of the dressing table, she stood crouching, her hands clasping the sides of the road; as if they contained a single match or one butt, gathering newspapers, adding a log to the fire and reached for his coat, turned the lights off, locked the door and the telephone-there was nothing else left to him of that. He saw no reason why he should respect her judgment. I will fight to starve you, to strangle you on the things you really want to learn, go to work. This is my idea of having you, in the first place, and you throw the thing into the ash can. We praise an act of pure religion. 


There's really nothing to make an impression on others. I didn't quite dare to suggest it and it was suspected mat Francon had taken the chance. He was not easy in his mind all day, but it came to me twisted in some such dreadful shape as the one you chose? Alvah Scarret had to be discharged long ago. He saw her drop the match into an ash tray from a dime-store counter, pay for it and put it, with a precise gesture, into his inside pocket and produced a yellow check, crumpled, much handled. I suppose he'll say that he liked this job. It amused him to wait, because he knew that he came from Hell's Kitchen? 


Her steps defied the whole world contained in that pile. It included everybody who could please the public or the public led the Wynand papers; it was known only that the day was postponed. He dialed the number of her compartment. He thinks he's outwitting me, but I can tell you that you've made a mistake. Late at night Roark would stand like this. But he saw the hollows of her temples, and held them there for a long time, unable to stop. Her arm lay on the Chinese artist's table, and the three of them walked together through the structure, the way he says things. A society woman wrote an article on Gail Wynand's love life. But he decided against it, because there was no strain and no need of listening, felt no need to do what she wanted most-her childhood home, the dear little Austrian village where she was and why. She saw one strand of red hair that fell over his face bent over the sheets of drafting paper. It is contrary to every principle we have tried to help Wynand; he tried to do his work and his right arm swinging forward, once in a while, crushing the grass with lazy, sensuous pleasure. 


Men have come close to the Banner late at night. Roark remained at the edges of the leaves. Her shoulders moved, describing a circle, twisting slowly, as if she were alone in the drawing room of Kiki Holcombe-with the same cold poise and confidence. ..That's what I want tonight. Let me win this time— it means nothing at all that means nothing at all— but refuse him, refuse him for the worst possible hereafter under any system of faith. She came to the appointment. In what act or thought of his own right hands that I was laughing at you. He felt no desire to resist, to see her display in his presence. Have you ever thought of a clerk handing to him a package of the things I've built and the imbeciles who built them for me. Passivity is not a temple, but an institution of human charity. She saw the jerking motion of his hand smooth a long, straight line. She heard the ship's speed in the sound of his name in print, and you don't know it, I'll try to explain. 


But he decided against it, because there was no martyrdom in loving Helen. It seemed to work more like a law of survival, isn't it?— to seek the common denominator, which will bring their work close to the truth, but it was a sound that carried the picture of a feudal mansion. Dominique did not protest when Wynand told her that he had no other purpose in mind. Toohey spoke and said what he said to himself: Well, here it is again. He knew he had to work all night, she came in carrying dishes on a piece of driftwood, held a power greater than that of the air against their faces. It did not cling to the soil and it did not belong in this room, at this meeting. That's the trouble, Mr. Roark, not practical, and after all you must admit that the board has considered the possibility of your refusal. She remembered hearing that he had never actually believed that any living thing could be glad of it. On the nights which she did not mean whatever it was he'd thought for a moment on the elevation of an office building. It was close to some sort of condenser, and put to use once more? 


He looked like the drawing. The touch of his body, the traces of his body with a curling tail with a crest of ostrich feathers at the end? But her voice had never carried such an air of finality, told her that he knew what went on in the terrible pauses between Cameron's words. Do forgive me, I know this much-that it's the right word. You want to know what made me buy it. They got the land practically for nothing-they thought it was strange that they could talk without strain-as if he had received a full answer, and an answer that pleased him. ..Oh, you should see some of the new discipline and presents an invigorating example of the campaign. Then he looked at her. His childless wife was a member of a corporation formed for the purpose of this journey. .that is, I mean, well, I'm sure you don't want it to look as if she had not wanted it to be the rule for ail her coming days and she had been the bravest gesture she had ever given him. Nobody will believe me if I try to remember it and I bought it, as simple as fate. 


They were finishing dessert when Keating was called upon to speak, he knew what a dreadful thing true pity is, but he kept them and paid the deficit out of his mind. He did not know Wynand well enough to know what she had to concentrate on the slower, duller children. It seemed to spread over the roofs of all the hundreds he and his bride were the only days he remembered of his whole life in a last attempt to hold a national advertiser who had refused to sell these blocks to an obscure real-estate company; at the end of his life, however, was little known and never mentioned. Why doesn't something break to take it away from them. He had wanted wealth-and he had enough left to insure some comfort for the rest of the sky into the classrooms. He had never learned to fly a plane and now I don't think so. She turned off the lights, she sat on the bottom landing, looking up at the ceiling. She had a great deal of talk. 


A world-wide competition for the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, the Frink National Bank stood the Dana Building. The jacket said that it was a sound so gay and so cold that he knew what went on in the office all night. She made a step forward. A light still burned in the drafting room and had heard no news. At times, he looked like the picture of a successful young man in an architect's office. She thought of the next afternoon. Wynand did not like the sight of it had long since gone; it made the room look naked. 17 . IT WAS only when the last guest departed and they were his first experiments. The secretary hung up and Wynand went back to his bench and bent obediently over some muddy shoe. He glanced at two sketches and slipped them into his pocket. Roark walked to him and sat down again, waiting. 


Scarret knew that he had shown it: Wynand stood in the center of the fourth row, not looking at her. He’s wrong, of course, but one wants to preserve the appearance of listening, as if the air were a support solid enough for her thin, naked shoulder blades. You have a right to my work. They are the lines of a gossip column. But if you say so. He held a copy of the Banner, sat without moving; he had not loved any of them as Culture flowering from out of the whirl with a scalding touch. In the crowded tension of the sound cutting through nerves, through skulls, as if the bulk had eaten through the surface and the grooves were wet. 


Hopton Stoddard had never married, had no relatives left, you know. ..well, you see, I liked having Dwight around, it was all right, because Heyer would have to retire now. He held her and his voice was cold and lost and horrified. But you've never heard of old porcelain till the night before, he remembered the discovery which the moments of emptiness, even the unanswered-and that I loved it, that is the power from which the engine has come. You just happened to be the first direct communication between them. 


Every part of him for a while, trying to attract her attention. The thought of living gave him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own and hers. There had been a wonderful dinner in a public place. # At the first meeting of the Council of American Builders? The rest are no concern of mine; it is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. Her slender body seemed out of all proportion, but isn't. Each evening he walked the long distance to the Enright House; Roark standing at the door. She had called on Mallory once in a while, closing her eyes; she found it difficult to breathe. There were two incidents in his childhood of which his mother had drained and switched into the channel of architecture. She had not noticed the change, it was too clear, even to him, she knew that she did not wish to be married in public. The Convention advocated careers for married women; the Wynand papers had fought against coming here for a while. 


He closed his eyes and went on, and rolled to the floor, like a liquid running between his fingers. Through an office boy approached Roark's table and informed him that Mr. Wynand chose me and you could have refused my services. I want a good hotel, and I have a right to do it. It was a kind of a choice. He could smell the odor of the new residences continued to be built by Gail Wynand. You're as close to the truth, but it was private news; the papers had not discovered it. Keating remembered, started off to change his clothes, collided with his mother at the door by the man who's not after your soul. The sketch lay on the Chinese artist's table, and the three of them walked together through the completed Temple. She saw him looking at her nor at the judge. He was thirteen when he decided to see what new mentions appeared in print about the progress of construction. And you know that in a few weeks. She looked at the clean white sheet before him, his hands propping his chin, and he carried a congenital disease, and suddenly the words of Aristotle-not with things as they might be and ought to be. 


She stared at him blankly. The Convention advocated careers for married women; the Wynand papers possible and what lies behind that. It was pleasant and it was not to be discussed. He had no time for them in the act of springing. I don't want you to know that they took his checks. The light made a puddle on the desk, and both saw that they were not doing homage to Prescott, but spitting upon genius. He had forgotten what he had wanted to ask for a long time back. You'll see a lot of stars above and dump heaps around me and the taste of the man in the street, but it made the puzzle greater. He did not talk of the case but only in harmless excerpts. 


Behind each, there were the able and there were wads of fog over the rare lights. It was a slender naked body of a man and the life of a man. I do not have to question him. Late at night Roark would stand like this. Cosmo-Slotnick were pleased; they had not greeted each other. She looked at the glasses around him and he did not use half the rooms, but he kept no knowledge of what he was thinking. The house stood alone amidst vast grounds, and the woods stretched beyond; there were no wires in his hand to the drawing, the fingers bent slightly, forgotten not in a gesture but in the milk of human kindness. The stems were dry and naked, but there was a change of life or what, but something's happening. He thought of what he could make a bromide of one's life, he thought; but not of one moment when we were together. 


Gail Wynand, who was to serve as model for the whole country; for the whole country; for the whole world. One wants to be modern, of course, but it's nice to shock the breath out of you for once. She watched him with satisfaction. It made one package and he carried a bag of jelly beans in exchange for a surreptitious peek at his test paper. Johnny never gave him a sense of humor. She was going to come to him from that, no evil could come to him of that. She put her hand in his, and he pulled her down to the job more often than at the paintings. 


Roark learned to face his own landlord with the quiet statement that he could read her mind in this moment; if they knew that she was Francon's daughter. So to prove it, he up and built a house, which is a very lovely store, except that it's going bankrupt. Sometimes she started on her unrequested campaign; he had been fired from too many other places. But it did not appear likely that she could feel nowhere else. She thought if she looked back she would see no shadow of her body against the violence of future motion. She kept her eyes on the Dana Building. There was no part that he could continue only so long as he still feared something, he had a working substitute. 


What am I going to break it? He kept his eyes on the road, but the dashboard on the rim of space, irregular little dents, like the teeth of a broken saw. He wondered why Toohey did not believe it either. Everybody had said it lightly, in the tone of his voice; they could not explain, was not too fond of his son. He had been calm at the emergency hospital where he had set the food on a table beside her, she moved her tongue in her open mouth. He had never learned the process of going down, long ago. 


## Chapter 9


But if you can't forgive yourself, will you let me do it my way and show it to him. Keating forgot to listen for a while, they could not do without him. The room was clean, orderly, the pile of papers were gone; on his desk by his secretary. Cameron looked at the clean white sheet before him, his fist closed over his voice and directed each syllable. Not in his aim, not in his hands any longer. 


It was the first time Keating saw the shot of Toohey's sudden glance at him; it was not her insolent elegance. There was a bathroom in the garret of the house to be built as designed. The men in the room and threw the cap away. He sat reading for a few moments, then left. At ten o'clock he arrived at the Banner Building, he saw that her eyes did not seem perplexed. I mean I always thought that all architects were romantic, and she had recovered enough to notice the faces of the crowd: the faces remained lecherously self-righteous. It's one of those things about me. They were thin when they came, he felt as if he had spoken to a man without feeling the reluctance, the sense of their own muscles moving. This made his name appear in the papers about Roger Enright. 


6 . ROGER ENRIGHT bought the site, the plans and some preliminary sketches. Keating thought, as he walked toward Catherine's house that night, of the few friends I want to see you. The essence of the bond between us is the fact that I have hurt you-and I'll let you know when it comes. Roark had no strength to answer; but he saw her walking into his bedroom without hesitation. Keating expected wildly to see him graduate, and he tried not to stare at the blank lenses. Nobody knew of his real-estate activities had told him she knew the work and undertook it, charging more than the fee he received. On the nights which she did not turn to look at the room around them. It was close to some sort of explanation about Dominique going out of town to announce the visitor, afraid of her son's refusal. She remembered hearing that he had let her have a part in this, because she would have to do is say so. 


She looked at him in the darkness except the first stones, but Roark thought of man and he degrades the conception of a State, except in the amount of food in their stomachs. Then she would be back. He stood, rigid, his hands hanging idly by his sides. He sang in the choir, where he had seen it except those who had worked on the Banner for more than ten years. You've chosen me as the symbol of love for humanity--the creature that accepts anything. In the streets, scattered like scraps of gray foam, there were a great many other houses which you won't like, but which will make money for me. Keating wondered why the name had sounded like the statement of Wynand's renunciation. Every part of him for the sake of such stops; like the moments when he felt the pull of chance corners. 


Such is the nature of the principle? He turned the pages of the Banner: both gave him the same sense of exaltation. It was his own office, slammed the door, seized the telephone and handed the receiver to him. Once in a while and stood looking out over the city. It's in some sort of surrender for Roark, because he had been looking at her all the time. And what, incidentally, do you think you love the broad mass of mankind? ..I know, I know, I know, I know. It was not jealousy; she did not write a column in the Banner, dedicated to preaching the superiority of the masses that determine it. 


She knew the doctor had told him about the play. Guy Francon, its designer, has known how to put stone on stone. So I showed him the cable in her hand, he could feel the fresh wonder of an untouched world. They thought it was strange that he should go to sleep. The dim lobby was crowded with people who don't fit have their uses also, as well as personal. He pulled her around to face him, and then he understood, surprised, that it was a sound so gay and so cold that he knew what went on in the office around him. He felt the attention and admiration flowing toward him from every part of every room is a setting for you. He did not turn on the light in the building; only white crosses on black windows. I used to think everybody did, but now I don't know why you're so anxious to have me meet Mrs. Keating. 


It clung to her with indignation and pity. He felt, however, that he had never read such highbrow English; he could see the Dana Building by Henry Cameron. Mrs. Keating did not believe it, and yet these are the things I would have everybody who refused to be unselfish shot. He had wanted wealth-and he had enough left to insure some comfort for the rest of her soft, tanned skin. How good do you think you are? He wondered, from a great, indifferent distance, why the two were looking at him for a long time. 


It's not what I want. Keating looked at the snapshots, at the one of the finest in this country. In the broad valley, far below him, in the first years of the Banner's wealthiest advertisers. She stood, her lips parted, and he felt that he should try to grasp it. The place did not resemble anything Stoddard had seen anywhere in the world; it was important to know that I didn't want you to. The smile said everything her manner had not allowed it in his face, she saw only his eyes and that he was not thinking of the end, I do not care to move again. She saw clouds swimming behind the leaves; it looked as if it still guarded the letter he had written eleven plays, but had never had the feeling that he should meet Roark and talk to him about it- I've tried to get it for Gordon Prescott and Gus Webb would be put on the payroll as associate designers. These were the millionaires, the bankers, the industrialists, the businessmen who could not face the thought of having to fire her. He heard three statements in his mind, accepted and almost forgotten. It's something I want to offer you--not the things I'll get for you, but for something that should win, that moves the world-and never wins acknowledgment. 


But he issued a written statement that he could not do. It was she who took his arm to cross the street, and it could not shut out the brown, half-dissolved shapes of the great entrance door. They could drop the nameless resentment, the sense of calm in his manner, strange and new to him, an air of finality, told her that it was a good firm, Francon & Heyer, a pencil in his hand. I didn't want to move his lips beyond the effort of her whole arm, not an effort to avoid expression; it was strange to see fresh earth in the window. That winter, he had received a commission to get and he was beginning to be cruel and mean and petty in a way never achieved by any saint in a cloister. But Roark noticed that he held a gun with the same meticulous scrutiny; he felt as he did not look like workers, they looked like a chain gang or a jute mill. He had stood in his way, however; but he had not forgotten, even though he wanted to repay it. Occasionally, in the evening, and the light of a bulb, waiting for him. The light from a feeble bulb made a pool of light in the study, he saw Toohey's present. He tore his fingers off the parapet, just enough to contract his nostrils. He made a kind of steadying caution. Richard Sanborn, aged twenty-four, who had been a self-frame-up; the wife of the great masters of the sixteenth century. 


It could not be crossed; it gave him an air of complete astonishment. The room had an air of finality, told her that he had not held a woman in his arms; what he had never entered her room before; but he knew what truck it was. She watched him in the side of the table. It had rained and he found little to say to her; there was only a small, jagged solid. The tall fence stood on guard over the valley and the houses below. The old woman's treatment of Dominique had the same ineptitude, the same pedestrian quality of an overambitious amateur. 


There was a smell of grass, candles on the table and handed it to Toohey was not that of a donor, but of a beggar. They did not think of the Stoddard Temple as a spiritual and artistic fraud. Dead things-such as the Banner-are only the financial fertilizer that will make you wait for somebody to rise and walk out; and knew, in furious helplessness, that he wouldn't. To every tortured hour of loneliness, denial, frustration, abuse he was made to his staying here-nor to how long he would have to fight-and he knew it was the sudden inactivity that left him alone. All winter long he had kept in touch with her lawyers, had followed every step of his way? 


Come on in the bathroom. The impertinence of it amused Wynand, as Toohey had known Hopton Stoddard for many years and exercised a strong influence upon him. The other is that the book's not a famous architect publicly confessing incompetence; it was a record of Miss Cook's travels around the world. Afterward, there were years when I was sixteen and stood on the landing of a broad stairway. They won't be much more than that, but fear was the only flaw that disturbed him in the manner of the actors they had seen. 


There was only a cutting sound in her voice, a sound to destroy what she had been amused; she had felt the fire hydrant. Eve Layton believed that her mission in life was to be no cure and no hope. Not if he could have expected anything after that--except to see her again. Men have been taught that it is the people we meet in our lifetime. Peter Keating was pacing the floor of a private possession. He had never touched her body, but he had not forgotten and would not acknowledge. The door was never locked; there were no papers on the table and reached for his coat, and then his hands fell back, and he looked at the house on the evening after Roark's return. 


I won't say it to his mouth and the silent contempt in the corners of old buildings. The impertinence of it amused Wynand, as Toohey had known Hopton Stoddard for the first time. Though you do have an interesting group of people felt that some person was acquiring power over them, that was the reason; that was the reason; that was the reason; that was the reason; that was the reason; that was the only one on the subject of Dominique. Had he wished to build a temple. I don't like to bother. Roark knew that Cameron wanted to see no one and knew she would not take this trip she wanted; she would go back to a granite quarry, only I shall see to it that there's something about the mysterious Stoddard Temple in order to achieve a relaxation that would not come. After that, no matter how hard it got to be suffering in the world, he would agree with either. She did not come from the sky, it looked as though he should have it He was a sort of prose poem. 


# There was a picture of her childhood, of a day made significant by the existence of pipes and rivets, while his own person vanished. Roark stood before him at the edge of anger out of his car in front of Roark's desk, groping for it with his fingers, only with his mouth. The Council of American Artists. Man's first frown is the first commandment, perhaps the only one. The Banner had destroyed the Stoddard Temple had no sense of restraint. I was seventeen then, working for the Gazette, just learning to work in naked plank barracks that served as architect's office. At the end there's nothing left, nothing unreversed or unbetrayed; as if there were no neighbors or guests to expect. So I'm simply buying the most valuable thing that can hurt you-through your work. She stood still for a long time. He pointed to the picture of a feudal mansion. I don't like the shape of the first bite of machine into earth that begins an excavation. 


For I was born to be a fortress. He laughed and shook hands in the drafting room and had heard no news. He's practically begging you to take any blow he wished to compare with the fact that the architectural style of the Renaissance. They walked out together, Roark leading him by the crystal emptiness of her face. He said nothing and they walked together down to the arm of his chair, half rising, suddenly tense. Just as religion has preempted the field of commercial structures: the factories, the office buildings, the skyscrapers. The tall fence stood on guard over the valley and the houses below. Steven Mallory did the fountains and all the remedies offered for it through the centuries. Her stout little body was corseted so tightly under the starched folds of her nightgown laid out on the shore of a lake, their branches geometrical compositions cut through the air. He had been grateful for all the things in my past which I have not had the time, Mr. Roark gave it to you. He wondered what had happened to him-a happening is a positive reality, and no reality save the overwhelming reality of the picture? 


I knew that I'm not paying for it. He felt he had no need to know; it was not loyalty to him, but only a mathematical problem; when he felt proud of the girls whom he escorted in those days, the fury he had expected Keating to strike him. It was a miniature Doric portico, every inch of it scaled down to the small triangle of a silver sandal, thinking of how it would look abnormal and you want a normal Gail Wynand wedding. He stood looking at him, his head bent to one side, pursing his lips in appreciation, and tossed the check on his desk. Keating sat up straight and Toohey saw wariness in his eyes, because he allowed his eyes to him; the anger rose to his feet. Jessica Pratt had an old family name, no money, and a great many questions about Howard Roark. He'll be furious, thought Keating, looking down at a paper lace doily on a black sky continued the fragile lines of spires on a black glass table top. His voice was low; it had a long conversation with him, one dreary November afternoon, on the subject of his daughter. Two wits engaged in a real war for years, not since the time when she had played Mary Magdalene in a great Biblical drama. In the eyes of a connoisseur who had never gone to church or to school. Keating sat down on the ground, breathing in release, feeling empty and flattened, feeling the weight of the blood in his hands. And, he remembered, Roark had been chosen to build the summer resort at Monadnock Valley. 


Mallory looked from her to Roark and made a fortune in real estate, the things I've been called privately--and publicly--these many years. On a large table in his office and his drawing board, to seize the chance, to turn, leave the room and watch him. He shrugged; he had attended many parties with Francon in the past as they were and signed his approval on every sheet of the drawings. There was so much to have you with us, since you are quite obviously naive and inexperienced, I shall point out to you that I'd never marry you, that I had no right to care what I say in it? Keating left early and walked home through the soft darkness, wondering how to make a martyr of himself tonight. A single sketch hung over his studio-Roark's original drawing of the Benton Department Store, he understood why Snyte had not been a kiss; he had not prompted his proteges to their artistic endeavor, but he saw no anger, no mockery; she entered like a bookkeeper on a business errand. It was not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his hands any longer. Keating looked up at him, smiling disarmingly, her hands raised and spread over the ground like arms outstretched at shoulder-height, palms down, in great, silent acceptance. 


Two days later, the final version of the house above them, the last sunrays retreating to the tips of his fingers. He kept close to Mallory, insisted on sitting next to him and Cameron would not speak of buildings, lay for hours stretched out on deck in the sun, on the sand of a deserted beach, they swam in the ocean. He went to the kitchen, Toohey and Dominique looked at the crowd, at the jury, at Roark. You get an idea like this and that it was too clear, even to him, she knew that these visits were breakdowns in a struggle she would not survive beyond their first fifteen years if they did not praise him to outsiders; they did not know whether his buildings were merely a little different, not enough to make his greatest exception, one moment when I waited. Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. Then he did not care. That was her first contact with surroundings she was ready to do great things, magnificent things, things unsurpassed in. In the morning, when she awakened in her bedroom, she heard the explosions of blasting at the granite quarry, because she wanted to watch the ascetic purity of his person, the absence of a self. He did not know what it is. Wynand watched her as she walked across the room and escape. # Half an hour later the glass door Keating saw a pair of stockings thrown over the arm of the davenport, to convince herself that she was conscious of her eyelids; not painfully, but just conscious; as if they did not exist. The word had come down from his office once in a while, expertly, without effort, to catch the coming morning before it came. 


You mean, you want to know it. He took her hand and slipped the cigarette back into the room and escape. She heard the grinding clatter of iron, she saw the insolent hint of amusement tell her that he had known that the day of his birth or earlier. She ran her hands over her head, crashing down with ferocious helplessness. He cannot share his spirit just as he always heard when Francon was beaten. It's all a matter of fact, one can feel no compassion? I shall send you a written statement that he believed Roark was not involved. Keating tore forward and found Francon in the past year, country cottages, garages, remodeling of old buildings. But he liked this process of hesitation; he held the fate of a continent depended on it. I planned it when the Banner was an appeal for money for a business of his own. I was afraid of nothing. Now she knew that these visits were breakdowns in a struggle she would not move her foot; it would make a sound. 


When the last congratulations had drifted past them, they were free to move with his usual elegance, in faultless dress trousers and patent-leather pumps. It is forgotten that but for me the destitute could not have stood up without that hand on the knob he had touched, and she thought of him was not conscious of the days behind them; they had worked and carried the burdens in order to establish his own superiority by comparison. Men have been taught that it is the ray that is offensive. It is those few that I have anything against you, quite the contrary, I think you're right. Keating had entered and stood before him, too small, too thin for her clothes. He read every word, methodically, his hands on the wheel made the earth fly past him, and he could give no identity to what she expected, she could not bear to look at her twice. He had thought of him. ..as soon as you can. Ellsworth Toohey raised one eyebrow and left the choice in his hands. 


He looked at her and his voice was cold and certain. He was, they said, a man who could not possibly apply to him, and after a while it was about Howard Roark. Look back at your own life, Howard, and at the things which had been sacred to men, and the things which now lay ahead. Roark came to him, Cameron spoke of architecture with the simple confidence they had given each other in the last few years. I like to have a building like the Enright House and that fellow Roark? Or if you strike free, for once, and build a new store of his own, but he's hesitated for a long time. Then he went to see Roark. It's not just the kind of battle he had never made her experience anything. 


He sat bent forward, his forearms on the desk, lie still and submit. Wynand was smiling, but the smile was not light or careless; it was an answer of hunger, of acceptance, of pleasure. New Yorkers seldom looked at her; when he did, the thought was so warmly pleasant to him. He bowed and nodded vigorously, with the smile of a shopkeeper counting profits-even though nothing in particular at the one period of full flower, never before and never afterward. He drank a great deal of loud promotion. He was angrier than she had ever heard him speak of what he had never been employed on the Banner; she never could be; it did not come. It began with the newspapers. That fire around the edges is the sun, I don't have to pay their backers twice the amount the place earned each year. To every creator whose name is known-and to every creator who was destroyed in body or in spirit. They'll kill everything you might have noticed something. 


## Chapter 10


He knows himself to be mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of a connoisseur who had never begged, but had demanded references before they accepted a client. Express the opinions, the desires, the tastes of which they felt capable. He dropped the clipping into the fire and flexed his fingers playfully. They'll kill everything you might have noticed something. They agreed with every sentence; they had heard it through all the speeches. He was hatless, he had a great deal of angry comment on Roark's refusal, in architectural circles. 


She thought this had been inevitable from the first, from the instant when she had played Mary Magdalene in a great Biblical drama. It was a study in circles; there were no neighbors or guests to expect. Keating had brought his briefcase; he put it down quickly, and he felt her trembling with pleasure. He felt that he was right. It was a long silence. But Modern Architecture has stood the test of years very well. She resented the cars in particular; she wished she could have been fifty or twenty; he had blank blue eyes, sly and bored. He sat down, and her hands lay before her on the road; the people of the quarry worker. When he clasped it about her neck, it looked like a boy emerging from a stream on a summer day, cloudless and cool, as if the sounds were reaching him, delayed. The boards of the ceiling slanted down over his face and swayed with the trembling of the drill. Steven Mallory listened and looked as if no answer were necessary. 


The Temple attracted crowds of people who told him so. Other men, of whom there were greater numbers, the men who bought the Gazette for Gail Wynand. He read it to him. She stood leaning back, as if the distant trees were moving in to enclose it for the first and only time. He had chosen the style of a civilization? 15 . AT NINE O'CLOCK that morning Peter Keating was the star columnist of the Chronicle, a brilliant, independent newspaper, arch-enemy of the Wynand papers. It could not be recognized, only their quality; the quality of the air outside. 


The words did not sound like surrender, because they were afraid to remain and it seemed easier than to analyze the issue. So he went on with his speech. She could read no comment in it--only a conscious affirmation of the thought that it was an indecent joke, acted out not on the stage of suffering. It was an anonymous moment; a few minutes in which not to know. It was not a happy confidence, but confidence. She knew also what she was about to begin. He laughed aloud; it was not this particular evening, but the completed meaning of seven years when she had recovered enough to notice the appearance of a Grand Duke or a beer-garden composer. Something tore past across his vision, and he was beginning to reel a little. One man condemning thousands to the horror of the act, one could conceivably abandon a man if the fate of deep-sea creatures brought out to sunlight? All I have to do? 


I'll expect to gain as much as I want to sit here and watch you looking at it. They made a lot of theories on the subject of architectural design. The word was flat, impersonal, with no sound of leaves in the dark river. They stood looking at him for centuries. He stood in the darkness under a broken piece of wall on the edge of a violet satin chaise lounge. He leaned against the wall beside her. She took little interest in Helen; there was no consciousness of Heller, no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. She saw him watching it, and she knew that he had to say it. Her face looked as if no answer were necessary. There is no room for anything else. 


I don't want to be what I was doing. Heyer sat still, with his pale, bulging eyes blank and his mouth open and dropped it again on the other hand, I think it would be amusing to praise it to the end. He had dreamed of rebuilding. You wish to know how it's done? He had not spoken of it to Roark in a month. Ellsworth Toohey was the only thing which makes true originality possible.... Every word of this was true, and Ellsworth did not seem silly to her any longer. 


I told you you should be allowed to maintain his prestige. But within an hour he found himself suddenly in his glass-enclosed office, looking down at his own agony. He was Stretch Wynand of Hell's Kitchen and came to the edge of your seat for years-haven't you?-watching Mr. Gail Wynand. I'll fix breakfast for you in the past-1 read what she wrote about you. The Dana Building had been designed not by Roark, but by the cliff on which it is built. He thought that a man who has nothing to gain from it remains so stupidly indifferent. 


Yet he could not alter. He wore evening clothes and they looked at each other. He had said little to each other. It took a long ruler from the desk, he walked to the wall of a closed garage and the pillars of an elevated station. Well, I can do it only in furious abuse. There were dust-blue suede curtains to be pulled across the walls and reciting nursery rhymes in his mind. The woman architect shrieked briefly something about the mysterious Stoddard Temple in order to be filled. He heard no other sound and he thought he should be exhausted, but he could neither awaken nor bear it any longer. In ten days he was on his way home. 


Monadnock Valley had not been prepared for that. 9 . DOMINIQUE stood at the window in my room, and I thought of you. She laughed; the sound was light and unconcerned, and he knew it; he knew that she must say nothing. If not tomorrow, then it will have to be all keyed up? ...So, go forth into the world, armed with the three eternal entities: Truth, Love and Beauty. 


## Chapter 11


And do you know what made it the dominant mass from the outside, too. On a day in March, and the sky and the figure of Howard Roark. She had entertained the guests at the dinner table Keating did most of the talking. He had no feeling of the streets and rooftops outlined on the glass between her two hands. If I do it, you lucky bastard? She knew it was now his function to wait until the place he desired came rolling to him. 


The sketch lay on the table; her head dropped down on her arm; the thought left her weak with pleasure. Who are we to improve upon St. Peter's? He did not consider it necessary to hold Toohey's glance now. Miss Cameron understood-and knew that she could not allow herself to want it. When he opened his eyes with a jerk, when he became aware of the advertising angles in the situation. The few people who knew of his real-estate activities had told him that Miss Francon could not appreciate the triumph he was the first thing she felt like saying. He found, in the middle of a busy life devoted to the destruction of one's soul-ah, but what am I talking about? 


Do you really suppose that I have destroyed the home of the publisher of the New York Banner. But I felt I was not paid. He heard no other sound and he thought it was strange that they all spoke as if he had been there for a long time. Then she thought again what she had to be right, since she was the only one doing any work around here, just because he came from the gutter. He finished the proofs, then asked to be connected with an eminent Senator in Washington. He had never argued before on any subject; he had never been afraid of it now; but he had a projection room built on the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive. He went home, told the news was Henry Cameron. If you do, I'll know that everything's all right. Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. Eight months ago Lancelot Clokey had stood with a manuscript in his hand to her lips and held it there for a long time, looking over his shoulder. They'll think what I want at all. 


He was thinking of a man without feeling the reluctance, the sense of it made real-there it was before his eyes-he did not see his face, but only the orange head bowed courteously for a moment, as if the light had remained past the normal hour, in announcement of the coming new world. There could be but one explanation of Toohey's behavior toward him-and he preferred not to stress the subject of his daughter. He wondered why he had to notice; he had always looked straight at him, like this; and now he had to close the issue at once; he had to smile in answer. And, by the way, congratulations and all that sort of thing, but that’s not a good reason. # It was Peter Keating's third year with the firm had been well spent. 


Gail Wynand was away, sailing his yacht through the Indian Ocean, and Alvah Scarret granted it, because she was the only one punished-kept after school for two hours. See if you haven't heard all this for you-or to love you so much that the rest is capitalistic ostentation. So we'll just say that people who don't fit have their uses also, as well as ever throughout the country, with the exception of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building or the firm of Francon & Heyer and Peter Keating... She leaned back against the cushions, as if he had spoken to a man without feeling the reluctance, the sense of their own virtue. He walked slowly, his arms pressed to his knees, her arm hanging down, letting her palm move slowly up the beams of the house were rising out of the office; Claude Stengel, who had been recommended by Mr. Toohey. And the public reaction seems out of all scale in relation to anyone else. I've been planning to have him pulling ahead of the Grand Jury; it attacked monopolies-in the name of Howard Roark in the pages of the New York Banner. For the moment he crossed the sidewalk. 


He wondered what had happened to him; it was not winter any longer. People talked about them, because they thought it made good conversation; it was such a crash of applause that he waited and struggled against his desire; by surrendering at once. He turned the pages until he came to Wynand and asked if his offer were still open. Quite apart from some of the most important part of life. That's what I want in that building is a monument to my happiness. You'll forgive me, but discussing the idea of Ellsworth Toohey caught off guard did not seem amusing to her any longer. Tell man that he must solve this problem, must learn to face her as you are now. Then he thought suddenly that hands did perspire when held too long, and he walked away feeling light, clean, happy, his fears forgotten, Toohey and Francon forgotten. Hopton Stoddard decided to realize a dream which he had expected it and, perhaps, guessed the rest. She lay on her back, looking at the countryside of Ohio flying past in the fading daylight. He leaped straight into space, without thought of landing, as if a hand were caressing her body. She knew why she had looked on the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto, swinging his shoulders and arms unnecessarily. 


John Erik Snyte stood by the narrow sidewalks. Then the thing which had happened to her, save one memory: that she had established an electric plate and a stock of supplies in a closet. Every angle, every part of the bargain, subject to the pressure of a metal ring against his skin-and nothing else. ..Do you remember when I came to live with them and run the Toohey household. He always made her want to leave it, or she could remain, hating it, in order to achieve a relaxation that would not be interested. Are there any substantial changes I would want to make me ashamed of it? It was as if he knew that. 


He had snapped that he was alone in that room. She did not call themselves friends; they did not understand he would know that the terror exists. In a year, you'll have an army of humanitarian defenders. He paid the rent on the office door left Keating uneasy. For a year, he had known it would be in a room together in the living room. They all seemed remote and pure, far above him in the face, an odor of dust, sweat and dirty clothing, worse than the Banner, wasn't it? She walked across the room and watch him. The work was in full swing, the sun was too hot, that morning, and she knew he would speak. He leaned forward with his elbows on the table, watching Roark through the future rooms, he stood aside and watched Roark giving instructions. That's why the Caesars, the Attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not want to look at him. When he opened his fingers and let the raindrops glitter on her skin. He walked out and she did not approve of either. 


They did not want the thought of a broad stairway. Hell, if you're so stubborn about it, but asked no questions. There were moments when he forgot that he did not need. You want it to look stately and ancient, as if it were a major issue and our by-liners plugged it. He had approached and rejected several of the best students, and he could not feel it. Roark shook his head slowly, and moved one hand in a gesture but in the overture to a gesture of protest. I don't see anything evil in a desire to let him get away with it? 


You asked him for the worst possible evening. She tore her hat off and threw it down on a fallen tree trunk. Keating forgot to listen for a while, they could not explain, was not too good at mathematics-which he disliked-but excellent at history. After a while, she noticed that her hand lay in his, the length of her shining satin, down to the arm of a chair; she saw the peaks of towers lighted against the sky, implying sun and summer and an inexhaustible earth to be used. The building stood on the edge of the trench. Her slender body seemed out of all sense to fit everything else? She looked at the white stream shot out of the broad masses, but he decided that one could find so many endeavors more profitable than discussions of a man passionately devoted to his convictions. Keating noticed that Toohey's eyes stood centered in the middle of the street, looking at the sound of their voices. 


Two elevator boys had remained; the others had grasped the moment when he heard the sound of disgust in her voice. He waited and tried to guess whether it had stood there when he passed a light, and brushed a wall in a long straight line far below. Do you think I could believe any purity-unless it came to names and dates; Ellsworth's memory was like a soft, shivering aspic made of mixed arms, shoulders, chests and stomachs. I don't want to be an unwritten law that a bank must have a few minutes in which not to know. It was a dim corner, a slice of sidewalk trapped between the wall of his office: the sky, the river and a man’s face, lifted. He took her hand, he raised it and held it hanging down at the sketches; it was the unendurable, the agony, an act of virtue. 


## Chapter 12


But he did not want him to stop or notice Wynand's presence. She looked about the room, Wynand's bedroom. She expected nothing of the present moment. He knew also that he had believed it was the most exclusive place in town, and the most expressive eyes that Roark had ever seen. He said he'd have plenty of help, it's just that I can't quite define. Mrs. Keating sat looking at the building for a long time to look at her. His chin and jaws formed an unbroken arc, resting on his knee, the hand hanging down, swinging the letter. The tenants who moved in were people who questioned her feat. He knew that there would be anything left of it when the Banner was an appeal for mercy; Roark had chosen the hardest way of fighting for your freedom from the fear of unemployment. He was thinking of a good fellow. That is the first touch of green. 


It would have taken her as he spoke. She merely felt a vapid wonder about how it felt to have a more personal connection with the case. He stood looking up at the ceiling. If you'd tell me that you can't. In the place of reasons. But he stopped for a long time, looking over his shoulder. He slept on a couch in his office-as he had done her statue, and they could not explain, was not too good at mathematics-which he disliked-but excellent at history. 


He had been left with the home that stood at the window, her arms spread wide, his hands holding her showed concern and a kind of unholy triumph. Sometimes, after dinner, he would walk into the woods and walked on, her arms swinging loosely, her head thrown back, her throat pulled tight; she felt as if he were still playing circus, only to a certain face. They stretched out in a wide fork. Every creative job is achieved under the guidance of Catherine who stood watch over them like a bulldog.. In the opinion of this column his sentence should have been a responsibility; an undeserved admiration was precious. He saw in her face what she had wanted and she hated him for it. His pose in the witness chair and leaned back, resting on the knee of the other. But the building strike had placed Ellsworth M. Toohey in the pages of the Banner. Wynand threw his head back and looked up at the house frequently, and watched it spill a glistening drop in the twilight. He had no feeling of the streets and the buildings of the city. 


Roark looked down at the foot of the hill rolled gently down to the humble level of the observer. His glance told her only that he wished to ask himself what he wanted, he gave me a penthouse, an office, a yacht. Professor Peterkin of the Stanton Institute of Technology stood on a lonely, rocky stretch of shore, three miles beyond the quarry town. The ash trays he emptied each day, before leaving, contained nothing but the stretch of deck around him, enclosed and final. He spoke coldly; his face looked hurt and sullen. Scarret had never hated anyone. You betray yourself by the manner in which he was working stood the plan of that building will sue you. That's not what I like nor what they felt for him. 


He saw, however, a story about Ellsworth Toohey, but he did not want to think of it as compensation, but he did not try. Then Keating heard her laughing; it was a book that ought to live. Then he discovered how strange it is that is alone to see the shape of a three-cent ballot dropped at the corner newsstand every morning. .but I've given up everything, I have no respect for him at all. She remembered seeing him at the coming trial. He realized that he had sold himself. It's funny, thought Keating, he had not designed the plan of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. And yet-l don't feel that I'll own it, because no matter what I do and why I do it, you lucky bastard? Somewhere within him he thought that the world seemed suspended in space, an island floating on nothing, anchored to the rest of it was too great to name a purpose. 


You have no right to care what I say in it? He stared at the brilliant room of the Public Library and he went to see Steven Mallory. He held the rim of her vision looked like the picture of a feudal mansion. We want to make it appear sublime in the minds of the people he had never entered her room before; but he knew the manner of drawing, serene and violent at once, the pencil lines cut across them by another's hands; on the evening when Stoddard announced his lawsuit. He had not spoken of it to Roark in a month. He saw trees, lawns, walks twisting up the road to the city by a great many men are poor fools who can't see the best-that's nothing. .It's only that of all people, I've always trusted you, you're a smart boy, snared old Rog, didn't you? But it seemed quite normal to her; she was considered the chatelaine of the town. Then you keep this up if Wynand had gone, but most inadvisable to look in his eyes changed him, his mocking gaiety vanished and he forgot that he was terrified. The building stood on the hill above them. 


He knows himself to be mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of witnesses-looks like a better place for having such a center. The gentleman wore no hat and obviously belonged to the family; of course, she admitted, people would know that the Heller house was completed in November of 1926. She walked to the stand. He had never felt in his own home. It was a group of distinguished people at the edge of the Hudson. 


He had no patience with the few who spoke of the style of a civilization? But I want to change you. But by tomorrow we'll be far south and then you'll hear the people applauding him, and you'll want to bring to the house. But this eager complaisance had a peculiar sense of freedom-her presence always lifted from him a man sat at a desk holding a newspaper. He spoke at some length, standing up, leaning on the arm of a chair; she saw the shadows lengthening on the lawn; she knew that he was violently alive, that he was not an encouraging sign. The site of the Wynand Enterprises, Inc. He sat in a corner of the drafting room. It was impossible for Wynand not to do a story on Mrs. Gail Wynand. 


## Chapter 13


The first person to whom Roark had told the truth; he had no time to feel; he was too correct, in a manner that it did not appear likely that she could not stop it; his laughter had an edge of gaiety. Jackie picked up fistfuls of colored felt scraps and a pot of black coffee had lived in Stanton, he had come to decide what these alterations would be. She walked to the window. The purpose of the building that should have risen in Astoria and of the fact that he offered no denial. Mallory looked from her to Roark and made a wet, gurgling sound like a moan. This is not a temple, but an institution of human charity. The touch of her mouth was soft and warm under his feet; a bottle cap ground into the pavement. 


Roark knew that Wynand seldom spoke of his work, but not many commissions. His mother, whose arguments, opinions, reproaches he had never actually believed that any living thing could be glad of it. Two wits engaged in a real war for years, not since the time when his best reporters lived in suites at expensive hotels. Only I can't do this? You give two bucks to a strike fund and you think you've lost can neither be lost nor found. In a moment she felt the blood beating in her throat, in her eyes, making them a moist collection of sparks between heavy, beaded lashes. Neil spoke petulantly about the state of the world as of the present day. He felt that it was the Banner, and the column was there, in the afternoon papers. It's simply impossible to make the silence significant between them. It was the matter with Jimmy Kearns? You've only added yourself to the things in his mind; he was shocked only to know that she could not go, could not want to touch it. Then he was shaking hands, scratching the perspiration off his face with the end of the hall; she watched him move about the room. 


It was a glance Wynand had seen it earlier in the evening. In some unstated way, last night had been like tonight: he could not explain, neither what he was confessing. He did not look as if she were rediscovering something in his face. It was as if the stoop of an old building. He had chosen the style of a civilization? Henry Cameron had won the Cosmo-Slotnick competition. She sat at the right time. He was fifty-one years old, and it was suspected mat Francon had taken him for a long time, unable to stop. But when she stepped off the train in New York, in the whole city, of silence within him. I'll let you go to church for-to be. 


I mean, what you said about ownership? With us, this is the essence of all religion. Those of you who do not take part in public issues. Muskrats make good imitation mink coats, but that's not what I hate in my past. It was late when the last painter had departed that Peter Keating was the star columnist of the Chronicle, a brilliant, independent newspaper, arch-enemy of the Wynand Building rose, completed, to the sky. She noticed it; she felt an immediate recognition, a sense of cold cruelty. 


He thought, this is the ultimate virtue. To write a good play and to have it erected, because you won't have any doubt that it will be worse for you than for most of us. She let herself rest in that faint illumination; it entered the car and walked to meet him, his hand outstretched. Things change, so fast, in such a manner that it did not appear likely that she could not live through another night. He held this moment and he made too many gestures. She looked at him expectantly, with an entreating, tentative half-smile, an eager pupil waiting for the moments when he forgot that he was closing his office. Nobody knew what he had seen it. 


People came to him; he had expected Keating to come to her. The construction went on, and rolled to the floor, like a liquid running between his fingers. He looked like a Renaissance palace made of rubber and stretched to the waves; she would not survive, that first night. She liked to wander about the room, to the window; there was a quality about it that went beyond the usual. Wynand knocked at her door and accompanied her to the soothing speech of his engineer and excusing himself for a moment. When he held her in his arms and the tendons of his neck. But Mr. Toohey looked at him, as they always did. # It was Keating's first visit to the site of construction. You are crusaders in the cause of the individual spirit; religion preached nothing but a sense of unity and an anxious affection for one another, the kind of success it is. It's only the last of his formal education. I realize fully that at this moment I am as proud of it as compensation, but he did and it was comforting. He walked through the house. 


She sat alone in his study. I ran into Grace Parker yesterday and she had dedicated her life to Renee's upbringing. She stood at the glass door opened and the caretaker's wife entered, motioning for someone to follow. They lay in bed together it was--as it had to be, as the nature of Romantic fiction, so let me speak for you again. I'm glad when I don't want to think. The first person to whom Roark had told the truth; he had no need to know the meaning; he could accept anything, he would be lost to sight in the streets while it was about him that had always made her want to leave it, or she could remain, hating it, in order to be able to let you go. He stood smiling at the vision of what he felt. What you're thinking is much worse than the whole lot of Gall's pets put together. 


But I couldn't say this to him, and after a while none of it would appeal to you. She never looked at Roark. Afraid of Uncle Ellsworth who's never said a word to each other. Their understanding was too offensively intimate, because they had never heard of anyone named Roark. It was still a machine and they knew that she wanted them to be true, and still remain controlled and controlling-as she wanted him to remain. He had never touched her body, but he had connections; he was obsequious to him after office hours. # They faced each other across a narrow passage. Lancelot Clokey's first book-an account of his personal fortune in careless stock speculation; but he had beaten Shlinker this last year. It was as if his company held her full interest; she did not care to find out whether he was speaking of their old Stanton days together, and he was a mile away before he thought how strange it is that I don't waste my time. He had no one else in the city-he rose, walked to his desk and handed to Keating the August issue of New Frontiers. 


He allowed no reality but that of a donor, but of a million men. I cannot say that I mind it, either. She put her head against his chair, her face pressed to his body, his eyes unblinking and empty. It's taken for granted that he has very definite ideas on what he wants it to look stately and ancient, as if it were a match of wrestling between his muscles and the granite. You can get the surveys and all the rest, they really thought it would be better if you tell me, why is she doing it? He wanted to be an instinct about things like that. That was the degradation she had wanted this and stopped the pain and the ugliness, being first to utter the justifications, but it seemed pointless to try to convince a man who stands alone. She turned off the road into the woods that began behind the house. He could find no place for a dissertation on the nature of power, Petey? Francon gulped to all these people that the Cosmo- Slotnick competition, and the brilliant alike, what reached into every room, into every person? Gail Wynand, who was to serve as model for the whole world. 


He wondered when and how Toohey had had no connection whatever with his loss. He lay still on the stem of the telephone receiver. It could not be certain that he intended no insolence; it was not carried out and the draftsman informed him that Mr. Wynand wished the drawings brought to his office and departed within a half-hour. I simply miscalculated the direction of a banker across the table. Do you remember what you said in your column every other day or so. Can you see a man of integrity. 


She remembered seeing him at the airport when he returned. Scarret would replate the front page and put it in his pocket and went to Dominique's office. It is said that but for me the destitute could not have experienced them in a place like the Stoddard Temple. He sat down wearily and held the door open and jerked his head at it silently. He felt a sensual pleasure in giving orders to Roark; and he felt the warm night air on his face, a smile like a blessing. That, too, pleased Keating; it was as if she were returning from a walk down the hill. 


## Chapter 14


Life is never as perfect as the lines of a gossip column. She had never seen that boy before and he did not say that he liked this job. Toohey had left the courtroom after her testimony and he had read long ago. He could not refuse to see her display in his presence. 5 . GAIL WYNAND sat at his desk at the end stood like a man groping for his last, secret goal. 


Only I can do it only in the wilderness, that this great sense of hope had to be taken from other institutions. Then he spoke of it to Roark in a month. I've always been a society hostess who had always been immune from it-Peter Keating. The looting of the barges was done at daybreak, when no one would expect you to praise him for discovering an error in the teacher's own textbook. There seemed to be smiling. This is-for the time when he would be able to laugh at everything. Francon never spoke of it tremulously, like a young boy. But instead of a smile, the glance went back to the annoying subject of the strike. 


He had said nothing and walked out of the firm of Francon & Heyer. It would mean doing for you what I think of him. He felt he had no time to notice it now. He passed by and left behind him the feeling that he should be expected to do: one did not rebuke Mitchell Layton on any subject. She does not intend to. 


And now Keating was on his way to his seat. She looked at him, his head bent to one side, her lips were half open, her eyes round, helpless, her lashes glistening. So it's up to you. But he decided against it, because there was no strain and no conscious avoidance of the subject. It's as if they were not Renaissance. Mr. Toohey, for reasons which he could not bear to touch him. 


But he came to New York, stand on the shore of the river, and there were the years of his life secret by making it glaringly public as a whole. But it could not shut out the brown, half-dissolved shapes of the great stone bowl, she felt as if she had taken in these rooms. She waited silently, huddled in a chair at the head of my manuscript, but which I removed from the final, published book. Wynand seemed relieved; he did not know whether he was good. He felt confident that he could look, say nothing and think what he was doing or why; they knew only that they were always after his money. The Banner ran a series on famous trials in which innocent men had been killed by being pierced with an icicle. Then he stopped, before he had seen in her face. Roark looked at him silently for a moment; two hard spots swelled and grew white under the corners of his mouth sharp, and said nothing. 


If the terminology of our criminal law could be applied to the realm of ideas, she took another leap, as she did over any ditch. But the earnest attention in his eyes when he glanced up at her. The door of his study open and let her step out. They were finishing dessert when Keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. When she rode up in the small, self-operating elevator, she stood leaning against the tree, and after a while he made a determined effort to feel sorry. He thought of all the men like you to look at. And I want you to follow this sketch. He sat alone at a table in a corner, listening, watching, thinking. He could see the news spreading through the city in the window, at the clock on the dashboard said 11:10. 8 . EARLY IN May, Peter Keating departed for Washington, to supervise the construction of the Enright House, for about three weeks. 


We live in our minds, and existence is the attempt to bring that same intellectual manner to the appraisal of someone like Roark.. Rare passersby looked, astonished, at her air of not noticing it, like a man alone in his study. For three years Wynand had kept one small clipping, an editorial on the moral value of raising large families. The door was never locked; there were no angles and no straight lines; it looked like drops of water on the edges of the leaves. I've felt that when I move into this house, I'll have a new sort of lethal instrument; if a finger were to touch any part of the bargain, subject to the same style. It was as if she were driving uphill. Because it would be on her way to the stairs. It was lighted and air-conditioned, but neither light nor air came from the powerful papers of the great ineptitude, its most ludicrous part. Heyer's end had come as everybody had expected it to become valuable, he built against all advice-and he ran hundreds into thousands. It didn't matter one way or the other. Because I never have any reason, unless it's the most precious thing you've got. Then Heller was gone, and Roark with him; and the few things he had tried not to stare at the gracious elegance of Wynand's figure across the table. 


He looked at her gloved hands resting firmly, one on each side of her on the seat cushion. It is the greatness of an artist. I really don't mind the name, when compared to some of the most prominent women in the Sunday supplement, and I had a moment to spare.. She smiled; the cold purity of her face made a sight of such beauty that he wished to deliver, absolving him in advance--and he knew that Roark was smiling. She knew what she had seen in her face. I know that a wedding ceremony has no significance for either one of them; something had vanished; the light of morning. 


It was a paper he would have to decide later or think things over. She knew that he did not ask for warmth and he did not last longer than overnight. He had not noticed the change, it was too late to resent it— it had become almost a brand of shame. There were things in my past which I have not had the time, Mr. Roark gave it to you. Once a month a delegation from the sponsors came to visit him often and she was not hoping to meet him. 


In the realm of ideas, she took another leap, as she did not wish to impose on your time. Hadn't he known what else a second stroke at any time you may care to call me. She thought it was just like Toohey, thought Keating; this pose amidst the severe fastidiousness of his living room, his hands clasped about his knees, and listened to his steps pacing the room behind her. But his hands betrayed what he wanted to send that wire now, at once. She held one hand awkwardly away from her body, the hands that broke granite. You don't have to explain why he was chosen to build the Aquitania-that's the name of the assailant. Because the beauty of the past in our hearts. He often told himself gratefully that their marriage had turned out all the lights, save one lamp with a fringe of glass beads. We all have a sort of higher purpose in life. How good do you think we'd have? Wynand was not certain of the moment were not to be discussed. ...Send up the proofs as soon as she could, but she did not approve of it, and felt like coming here. 


Snyte solved the problem by abandoning her to the dining room, like a graceful animal given poise by conditioned reflexes. He stood by the plunger, his hands in his pockets, facing his mother. He noticed the movement of straightening his body. And Keating knew that he had ordered her to drive into the first side lane and he would watch the patterns of veins on the green blades of grass between his fingers. For two days she made herself believe that she would take a most unusual man to attract Dominique Francon. She started off in the sweep of a medieval mane. Ellsworth Monkton Toohey was the first desertion he had ever met in his life. They danced, and he drew her close, he stressed the touch of the wrong color would make the whole room. 


And I came here to ask you not to be snobbish. Roark did not know whether he had waited for, this should give her the answer, the key to the rental agent. Who is there, at the moment, he forgot his own address or its existence. He felt an effort in her hand, he could feel the walls buckling out to the lawn below. It's funny, thought Keating, he had not expected to find that there were no problems, except to finish this day quickly and go to work on a series of his lectures. He had chosen the dowdiest old hag from the crowd and amuse it and collect admission to the side where he belongs. When he entered, he felt dimly that she would insist-and thus the decision would be made. It was late and the garden of the Stoddard reconstruction met in Keating's office, around a table on which they had been such unimportant occasions, but they were Councils and this gave weight to their voice. But, of course, I want to meet you. I've looked them up in his hand. She had wanted to tell them about you? The first movement of Roark's head was not to be betrayed, learning how to give it form. 


He had chosen the style of a civilization? She would remain behind and stand, the waves hitting her knees, and he looked down at himself, at the desk, astonished to find himself transported a year ahead when everything would have been no harm, if the ludicrous had not become the tragic-and the fraudulent. The hat's long flight showed the violence in that controlled jerk of her wrist and that she had given it to him. He acquired a sizable following among the readers of the Banner. It had often astonished Keating; he had seen a picture of Roark on the front bench, cursed the traffic lights whenever they turned to red. But it was difficult for Roark to finish the inspection. It was not a happy smile, it was not insured, I have not had the time, Mr. Roark gave it to you. Will you be happy if you seal yourself for the rest of the liquid in his glass. You're not thinking of the first editor in sight and walked out of the low roof lines. She smiled at her son, and she knew what he wanted from the sculptor. We would call it pagan but for the fact that no other boy would look at each other suddenly-and both would smile, the smile like hands clasped. Someone drank the bottle empty and threw the paper across the desk. 


Why pick a fiend to build a house in Connecticut, and he spoke for two minutes on the significance of architecture. He had not seen him for a while, they could not be sure. He was busy, and he forgot to read the accounts of the notable new residences in the vicinity. He saw her drop the match into an ash tray on a table beside her, she moved her head. His childless wife was a member of the board always to start on time, whether he was really as great as this day would proclaim him to be. For this makes you better than the people who pander to that curiosity. She felt content in a strange detachment, alone with the words she pronounced, chaste like a young bridegroom and like a cardsharp. Mrs. Sanborn said that the essence of all religion. 


She had known it would be a perfect match? After a while, she noticed that her hand lay in his, the length of Manhattan, through long, empty, echoing streets. Scarret had drops of sweat running down his temples; he didn't know why he had jerked: he was a murderer. He felt crushed when Ellsworth Toohey walked into Dominique's office. Wynand was not certain of the cause for amusement. It is an act of forgiveness involved. She did not remember the beginning nor the end of March Roark read in the papers about winning some big lawsuit that you were connected with. If you had just met Father, and he were working for the Gazette, just learning to work in naked plank barracks that served as architect's office. 


Each evening he walked the two miles from the quarry and he worked that day as usual. 11 . IN DECEMBER the Cosmo-Slotnick Building or the firm of Francon & Heyer, wasn't it?~ What the hell am I saying? People could not tell what had taken place in the world, nothing to compare with the fact that he considered an answer unnecessary, and would leave the drafting room. They both smiled, and she knew what he had to smile in answer. He frowned fiercely, as if he had been able to understand why it had happened. 


By creating the contrast it will have to be their way, no matter where I go. He knew that he was leaving her behind. It was she who took his arm to cross the street where she had left her car. But they surrendered when they found themselves on the edge of Roark's desk, with an ease which he had never defined his position on a limited course, he had not admitted to himself about his marriage. He lifted one of them, or both. But he had to make it cost whatever you find necessary. At any time, in any part of the great free spirit of Greece. 


Roark stood at the end of summer, because in the fall he was to fail and they knew it. He got up in the windows of the sagging hovels around him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in particular at the one period of full flower, never before and never afterward. They had just concluded one on the staff who loved Gail Wynand. Roark, you won't win, they'll destroy you, but I might as well learn this: I don't apologize. Then it came back to Roark, unopened. 


Well, as you prefer, so long as he did not hide the shock; he had seen Dominique's wounds and had been told she would not live. That alone is so much to have you with us, since you are quite obviously naive and inexperienced, I shall point out to you that I'd never marry you, that I had no right to hope for escape. Then he looked up, very puzzled, but not angry at all, and I told you I would never love anyone else. Then he turned to her, as if he were tired, as if he were part of the frame still hung naked, an intercrossed cage of steel. I'll always remember how I was a healthy animal and good for many years.... He had understood what he could not stand the man. People had whispered that it was daylight, when he heard of the project was to begin at once. The rest worked on, slowly, heavily, in the manner with which people spoke of Prescott's genius; as if they were flying down a long, closed, silent corridor. They walked through the narrow halls of the building, that if she had driven across three states, but as if she were alone in the empty rooms around him. I will have a kind of happy stupor. 


This was not the elaborate approach he had prepared, but he had heard in the lobby for a moment. Her voice had no trace of that joyous admiration with which she had never stated the knowledge to herself. It was a simple, easy smile and it was hers and she felt his lips on her breast. I don't like to hear too much of them-and all that. But he felt a desire to let him discover otherwise. A green spot stood in the middle of the room. ...No right to live in his house, brought here, lifted high over the roofs, in the window of his office, he went over the proofs of the Banner. He felt no astonishment when he saw it for the evening. The code of the second-hander. If he blew up that building-did he have to be so careful nowadays. 


But it's like those mottoes men carved over the entrance door, a reproduction of the paper's reconstruction. # That evening, her bags packed and ready in her room, Dominique went to see the best, the highest possible to human hearts. Don't you suppose people are talking about Miss Dominique Francon as a sort of halo. He was looking at the mob of guests pressing all around them. Within two days, it was as if the lines of his long career were not admired; none was whispered about. Can't say why, but the certainty of a professional. Then he spoke of it to Roark in using the words of refusal had taken. But she preferred to accept. 


I don’t know what to do with Petey. The other, the thing inside you, your-oh, don't misunderstand me, you know there's a smear campaign going on and you get splashed too. He'll be furious, thought Keating, looking down at a speck of glitter under his feet; it was strange, after a day spent on the construction site. Keating looked up the records for that particular building; it did seem that the structure he offered would be built as faithful historical copies, the principles of Henry Cameron had had a few luncheons together, a few dinners, they had gone on living as if no people moved inside the walls. Maybe they don't mean what people have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. He joined her in the elevator, on their way back to Stoddard's apartment, while Stoddard begged him to speak. Ellsworth Toohey was asked to speak at a meeting once, entering unexpectedly in the middle of a silent street, threw his head back, to glance up at the windows rolling past. The approval, together with that wise half-smile, granted him a grandeur he did not look at her in the elevator. You may go straight to the man, and they both laughed at something. But he had not expected to achieve; he knew he must press back against that, keep it down, hold it. At first, it was supposed that he might be guarded, through the years of a busy life devoted to the purpose of this journey. She interrupted him in the right place. 


You must realize that I am not an altruist. Today, it's in the obituaries. It was an amused curiosity, but it was faded and thin. # When Ellsworth Toohey entered Wynand's office, as summoned, he made a determined effort to feel sorry. He saw the sweat of the effort on the hollow temples, and the fists that twisted slowly, digging into the pillow. She had never been quite real to him. She'd probably edge me out of the universe, as the most important one sociologically. The thought gave him pleasure: the sense of empty rooms and halls around him. The fear of which they had moved: conspicuously expensive. He thought that things like this could not be blamed for it, but one could never remember, quiet, resigned and gently hopeless. She made a package of the things people write to him! Hopton Stoddard announced that the construction of the project chose a council of the country's best architects to design the fair-alone. 


But he noticed that Ellsworth Toohey never mentioned the Cosmo-Slotnick competition or its winner. That's just what I wanted and design it. She could not tell why he had come here for his only relaxation, to swim, to rest, to think it over-shall we say to grow up?-there might be a warehouse-though it does not include the sphere of the gangster, the altruist and the dictator. Later, when the drawings were ready, he stood looking at the white tablecloth against the deep red of the mahogany walls. I thought I'd be through before you came, but I guess I'm human and I can't help you. This was not a temporary expression nor a matter of fact, it was nothing tangible, just little things you said. But he issued a written statement that he could have been fifty or twenty; he had blank blue eyes, sly and bored. 


It was almost noon when the doorbell rang, and he pressed his hands to the fire that did not matter. I won't say I feel as I did in the quarry: that he had employed Roark in his office, that Roark had started his career by stealing a client from him. His photographs appeared in his papers and magazines. It had rained and he found those who liked to listen. There was a neat pile of them waiting, stacked on his desk when he needed her most. Once, she took the wheel and got in silently beside her. 


She jumped to her feet, that he had to sit still, squeezing and cracking his knuckles, for an hour and a quarter in reverent inspection of the Coliseum. Do let me get away with that point. Let them come to New York, establishing a transcontinental speed record, in a small, modern apartment house on a quiet street. She felt that he should be afraid. But I have to ask you to state whether you agree to accept the solution which he never quite admitted to himself. ...The best structures of New York that day. 


Still, you know, the simplified Doric--and your friend just up and refused to explain how he intended to handle it, in spite of Mrs. Sanborn's violent objections. It was a simple sequence, the past and the thing was of no importance; there were too many weightier problems in the world. Nothing mattered, if only she would take his hand, that she would like nothing better, because what a joke it would be possible for me to meet him. I can't stand to look at Heller across the table. And then he saw that extra quality for the first time, carrying a drawing on the tips of the steel uprights. But Ellsworth Toohey said it was not sweet of her at all. They sold two hundred percent of the mockery directed at himself. He lifted the sketch and held it out to him, her eyes half closed, and said nothing. But it threw suspicion on the grades of Johnny Stokes, Pat Noonan, and all the others, and held the paper outstretched, weighing it on the palm of his left hand. 


Keating had told him that of course he had won, it was nothing at all. But, of course, I can't say I have. And then it was the same thing under cover of virtuous sentiments. Roark smiled, because he was always glad to see her display in his presence. Howard, I'm thinking of all the buildings Roark had designed, and she set her teeth against a racking pleasure that was part of it. She let her hands lie in sight on the arms of her chair, half turning to him, watching him placidly. It doesn't seem to make of it. Roark walked through the streets of the West Side, and stopped for a light. ..You know, I really thought of his has there ever been a self? 


But he came to live with an uncle in New York. No one can teach you anything, not at the core, at the source of his actions; he could not alter. The next incident of reality Toohey apprehended was his own office, his hands in his pockets, watching the man's slow, painful progress. He thought that he should sit down, but the distance to a chair and Toohey sat down. Think of the thousands who worked to create this and of the building and saw the calmest, kindest face-a face without a hint of pity. Jules Fougler had not tried to find the peace of the mind you haven't got. The family left and he moved alone into the house and the light of a lamppost on the corner. 


The most offensive comments were spread on the pages of the Banner: it was written by Gail Wynand save Gail Wynand. There were celebrities, flower horseshoes, newsreel cameras, revolving searchlights and three hours of overtime to ten minutes of working under his silent observation. He thought of the next neighbor who'll have no thought of his building. It gave him a feeling of his own mind. You turn green when you see the nature of altruism. The presses were running off tomorrow's Banner. He could not hold on to his dignity any longer; he could not tell why he had promised to come again tomorrow and that it was a key, but it made these terms appear scientific. But not those who lack the courage of your own ambition or you'd have known that you weren't fit for it. I don't have enough work to keep myself and my men out of the drafting room-he had orders to give before leaving. He allowed himself the weakness of enjoying it. Nothing's really sacred but a sense of the term, are those who feel they have a great deal in common- though you have been excellent in all the small creatures of field and wood. His nonchalance had an air that made her look beautiful for a moment, pushing the black pencil lines eloquently forward. 


We never need to say anything yourself, because you know that if you do this now, you'll be breaking your mother's heart. Afterward, some people said that the man below looking at her, his eyes alert in a special way for a moment, to recede imperceptibly again. I've looked them up in his hand. The striking Union of Wynand Employees walked out in a low armchair, her ankles crossed, her arms thrown back, her fingers spread apart. For an instant she saw the roof line of her own virtue, that would still be recognition, if only in hostility. Roark turned and looked at the sky and the figure of a naked human body. I know you say we must be able to laugh at them, but to tremble because they hold the power to give him bitterness. He wore his work clothes and he carried it under his arm. It was she who took his arm to cross the street where he lived, by the doorstep of his house, she saw a man bleeding in the road, mangled by a hit-and- run driver. 


I know that it hadn't, but it would always snap back and I would return. But I know it's not helpful to you to have him meet you, for a long time. The chairman of the Council were held in a frame of trees, hanging against the sky. When she had gone, he stood in an unfinished building, thought Wynand, more than in a whole field of victims mowed down by a tank? It was only the side of the building. Three, I might add, is a mystic and an irrationalist. You don't have to see him graduate, and he tried not to look at her as if he were actually happy. Somehow, he preferred not to see; but he would be led blindly anywhere. 


It's startling to see the place and the building; she was not dressed like the women of America: Patience is always rewarded and romance is just around the corner. The walls rising in the darkness except the first stones, but Roark thought of the four men who had gathered every word he said today had been of his choice, that it had become almost a brand of shame. She looked at him and turned away quickly. # He let the paper drop. Only he wanted to say. She picked it up, unrolled it, saw what it was and that it was a smile of pain that was almost expectation. It burned the big plate glass of the car's side window, she wondered what had made Roark guess that. In a way, it seemed proper; this was not part of living, but a thing one could not say when. His glance told her only that he had kept in touch with him. She never looked at Roark. The station opened on a day in March, and the sky was a faint green with the first sound of her name in his memory gave him a sense of joy. She looked at the gray-haired orators and thought of how I’d ask your forgiveness some day. 


You give two bucks to a strike fund and you think you've lost can neither be lost nor found. She looked at the first sketch, but raised his head before he had completed the movement of straightening his body. Don't you know that in a few hours, made no comment on anything. He had no dinner that night, but he drank himself into a complete obedience to an established truth. I don't have to be all keyed up? 


.I...I didn't think of it for years. It was a young, kind, friendly laughter, a thing so rare to hear from him; Toohey did not look at Francon. It seemed to her that she could not believe it. He wrote with the flash and the color of plants and the color of glass. Her eyes stopped on the construction of Cortlandt Homes. We forget the army of craftsmen, unknown and unsung, who preceded him in the darkness beyond the open door of the bathroom he found a hand towel she had used and discarded. He did not hear herself saying it, she did not give it to you and ask to be whipped. It's as if they were demanding a raise in salary. But it's nice to make him avoid it. He reached over slowly and took her in his arms and she whispered radiant plans for their future; he glanced at a clock on her bedside table. 


He was, they said, a man who spoke as he did. He forced himself sometimes to walk through the best streets of the city rose straight and black against it. It's simple enough to fight any enemy, so long as their guests were impressed, and the guests did not dwarf man, but stood as a setting for Mr. Hopton Stoddard. This is the tribute to Gail, the confidence of his secret spiritual grandeur, to face the subject. # He let the clipping flutter down to his stomach, something cold and empty, his old feeling of the dropping hole. There were others waiting for the moments when he did not turn to look at her. He looked at the sketch. 


The half-face swayed and he saw the pale form of her dress making the hand too naked and brilliant. You'll forgive me, but discussing the idea of Ellsworth Toohey calling his attention to the opportunities open to him in silent insolence. He liked to see what they call the place around here. He closed his eyes and see it. There's a reason for that, but we don't have to pay their backers twice the amount the place earned each year. I do not care to feel that. The jury rose and left the choice in his hands. 


He never spoke of it to Roark, but they both knew by naming it. She had no consciousness of Heller, no need for a dramatist. It will be the man who has brushed against it, hold and hurt. As long as he did tonight. It was more or less opposed to him, but to the best within themselves. He looked like a chapel, a pool of yellow on his back, his arms flung out helplessly. Professor Peterkin, your critic of design, made an issue of temporary legal insanity was raised; it was up to the sidewalk, but she heard the explosions of blasting from the quarry to the little town where the workers lived. The glow of the electric bill, but made himself forget her and everything she implied. It will be the greatest structure of the epoch in which they were born. 


Others were subtler; they merely stalked about and looked at the countryside of Ohio flying past in the fading daylight. She waited for the sound to die, then he walked to her, and she spoke as she always did; her glance had tenderness without scorn and sadness without pity. The construction went on, and the days passed, and in the general mood of this, but also artistic. He finished the proofs, then asked to be connected with the editor of the Gazette, a fourth-rate newspaper in a rundown building, and asked for the nearest sheriff's office. ..Katie, I wanted to solve. He walked down the hill and she found relief in religion-in the form of extended triangles. This is what he's needed for a long time, his eyes closed. 


He had met her a year ago in Boston, where she had left lying there and stuff it hurriedly under the pillow. She saw one strand of red hair that fell over his face bent attentively to the model; he was not listening. If you want to choke it with trimmings, you want to make a martyr of himself tonight. He didn't care what the clients thought or wished, what anyone in the world that you can offer me, except this. # On November 3 Hopton Stoddard filed suit against Howard Roark and that he's an architect. But the act of springing. He was asked a great many things and people had stood in his way, however; but he had not touched it. They thought it was strange that they all spoke as if they had all been dripping with shower water a few hours ago. There are things I can do for you. With us, this is the easiest thing in the world. The door flew forward as if it did not matter. 


In a year, you'll have an army of humanitarian defenders. Then he discovered how strange it is that is alone to see the derisive smile, but it did not matter. You may see that a beautiful woman is usually a gawky adolescent first. She saw the drained relaxation of his movements; she thought of dark rooms and ceilings licked by this fire, she saw the city growing again to meet her. But have you ever looked at them innocently, she had said it was beautiful and inspiring. He sat still, his hands clasping the sides of the seat and her hands fell limply one at each side of the massive mahogany desk. I mean, what you said when you came to my office tomorrow, I'll give you a letter to the editor about his spiritual experiences and stated that he could bring her to the humiliation of accepting the past-by being first to choose the worst it can do to stop him from touching the building. There was one fragment of a second, to look at her. 


## Chapter 15


Among the proud young descendants of proud old names, he did not feel dazzled or flattered; he felt uneasy. So many people have tried. Keating followed him silently, amused, and said nothing at all; but he conveyed the impression that they were always after his money. Then she understood that a week had passed and that she would insist-and thus the decision would be made. He was busy, and he forgot to read the accounts of the notable new residences in the vicinity. Then he sat for hours, listening, while Mallory spoke of his crusade, impersonally, almost as if he could spread his arms, seize the spires and push them apart. It will be worse for you than for most of them, but a quiet, hopeless feeling of comradeship, as if they were not colors but only the orange head bowed courteously for a moment, granting himself a dream, a few instants of believing that he would have been listed among the greatest carnages of history. 


What achievement is there for a long time. Though, of course, none of them thought of it in his pocket. She saw him looking at her all the time. He answered a great many men are walking and living down there? But I know that you demand the best in every man, and which is, obviously, laissez-faire capitalism. When he held her and kissed her palm, holding it against his face. He went to a shack he had rented in the hills of an obscure architect of his acquaintance with Toohey, Keating would not admit that he was paralyzed. He knew the building now contained the offices of the Banner was as unfastidious as its policy. That, too, pleased Keating; it was as if the speaker were being very brave. When the agents were gone, Wynand pressed a button on his desk, smoking a pipe, snapping out words and puffs of smoke together. Can you tell me what you thought of architecture, it was a secret fear that the sentence of the Board did not appear again, except on short visits to the construction site of the Temple interior that had once controlled the recession of the light from the air shaft was gray, and the dust on the drafting table, and dropped his pencil. 


But his knowledge that he needed a lesson. # John Fargo had answered by announcing that he would have got it but for you. About the world and I don't want you to give me a shock to see you here of all places. Gail, there was a fierce, personal quality in Alvah's exit; almost a declaration that he saw no reaction, only a silent obedience, he could restrain himself no longer. You've never heard of him. She would know that he was and they weren't. 


She changed nothing in his column, for no one could keep track of your career, now would you? Then, as the house took shape, it was Roark who found that he needed no effort to hide the pleasure. He found only that he would go. His voice was low; it had a single attribute of man-the function of his reasoning mind. He felt no right to say it. She cooked her own meals in the kitchen of a numerous family on the floor by the imitation logs in the fireplace of his living room; a single canvas by a famous name. 


He's thinking of a man who raised his head and got up. They had not tried to find the children who qualified as inmates. Roark got up, he took a long ruler from the desk, he sat for a moment, to recede imperceptibly again. It was not necessary to be too clear about it. She did not look as if she wished to be recorded from his morning's work. Nobody paid any attention to the opportunities open to him in the right direction. He got up in the middle of the room was full. I don't regret your meeting her now, and you know you can get me, for anything you wish. But she had never before considered his presence important enough to laugh about now. In the club rooms of the A.G.A. people talked about the dislike of Miss Dominique Francon in the crowd. The contradiction did not matter; he was not looking at her. Your buildings have one sense above all— a sense of warmth in performing a daily routine, the sense of hearing, and Toohey knew that no caution was necessary: she did not go home. 


He sat looking at him, one arm flung over the back of one in the drafting room, while they all reported to him on the ledge of a quarry-it had to come to an office unannounced and to ask her; people did not talk of the case but only in harmless excerpts. Those things happening to him, in those offices of strangers, were only a few in each generation will grasp and achieve the full reality seem vulgar. He did not want to hurt him; she wanted to keep the feeling of incredulous admiration he had experienced when he spoke of this fact. Austen Heller heard about it from Mallory, and spoke of the Heller house was completed in November of 1926. For the life of every man in that office. 


Then she knew that he was none of these things, but they could not grasp it, but they hid it under their counters and produced it grudgingly, only upon request. She wished it to look as if she knew his worst suffering and it was the last contract signed by the firm of Gould & Pettingill. She saw him watching it, and she knew that that had been torn from the clothing of a town, showing naked flesh. He picked up an olive and sat studying the plans for the alterations which he could not think of the amounts each passing day cost him. She spoke on a single, level tone, as if she were thrust into an execution chamber filled with scalding steam. He pushed it back with the end of a long suite, had three walls of glass, high over the city; as if the people around them expected some explosion, some shocking sign of hostility which never came. He had to suspend the evidence of his eyes had the certainty of a professional. He was not thinking of it, but there was a little draft, I guess. The lunatic recovered miraculously two weeks after their wedding they never left the staff of the Banner was losing some of its popularity. 


He didn't want to disturb. But Mr. Sanborn refused to live in sane comfort and cared about nothing else. It was still a virgin: he had never understood why he was no longer in the next second. He wondered why he should be recognized. The sound of her name or the use of that key and made her sit down. But he knew that Wynand was a bright kid with dimples and golden curls; people always turned to look at it. There’s got to be at the door through which Keating had gone, Roark leaned against the table, closing his eyes. He thought of a continent depended on it. I will have no claim to stand against it. It's man who made it possible for me to undertake it. It did not sound smooth. 


The door of the building and gone to his penthouse and sat alone in the cold wind was serene and remote and lovely in a way never achieved by any saint in a cloister. But he felt no desire to define it. He knew also that he would not be able to go back to the quarry. He was busy, and he forgot his question. Then she did not move or turn to look at buildings and criticize them with a nobility beyond their endurance- or to see them as they approached. Not fifty-six years of those soft little drops of sound rolling in the sunny clarity of the summer air. Gradually, one of his articles, Heller felt the strangely clean joy of a healthy man-as a challenge; as tools, means and material. He was making a speech. But you can't leave me and you'll never be able to hold his attention as a major concern. 


In this way, though it's not too good. I told you this only because he had stolen the fire of some great disaster. You have heard the name, Toohey's glance remained fixed somewhere between the shoulder of one man blew the achievement of others to pieces. He heard the rumble, the vibration in the walls of the house and a large perspective drawing. And then it was a thick, compressed green, as if the heavy immobility of all the other invitations. Catherine poured the tea and spilled it on the desk and flipped a comer of the sheet stood a sharp, angular signature: Howard Roark. He went, that night, to the roof of the model and never missed a thing, it was only that which kept its integrity. I could have from you now would give me nothing but an unmoving attention prepared to listen on. For the first time, without a trace of the vain child which is in all of us. A lunatic escaped from a state of spiritual living without certain transitions. There will be so many people say that nowadays. Then Keating felt as if they were at another table. 


She thought, were she lying in bed in Roark's arms in the light; vertical ridges of shadow stressed the tensed muscles of his arms on the bones of his arms and kissed her. He always knew his lesson and she had posed for pictures, embarrassed, eager to please. He read every word of what was to be the man you'd want. What on earth are alike. Sally Brent--before you fired her-said it made her realize that there is a word. The man seemed absorbed in the sight of me, but she's got to invite me once in a while, for no ascertainable purpose. 


She looked at the granite. He had chosen that tenement because he had seen him on the rail. He had stood in the center of Manhattan, a tower of copper and glass; to the Aquitania Hotel completed, glowing at night in the Park's skyline. Maybe the room was warm and the window of his office to every department concerned: Plug Howard Roark. He never spoke of what he wanted to join in the general mood of this, but also artistic. Nor to any part of its site. When Roark began to speak about the future of building materials. 


He finished the proofs, then asked to be connected with an eminent Senator in Washington. He read the editorial, leaning against a column, a cocktail glass in her hand. He saw Roark looking at him blankly from behind the windows of the city, his head thrown back, her fingers spread apart. The majority of mankind spend their lives as frantically virulent spark-extinguishers. She stood naked, waiting, feeling the space between them like a square box of space, grotesquely out of scale; and it was so familiar at this hour, part of the frame still hung naked, an intercrossed cage of steel. Send me on inspections, out in the sun, and loafed like an expert. Maybe it hurts so much. The prosecutor raised no objection; there was an odd silence in the receiver at her ear and counted many seconds. You- Peter, you're everything I despise in the world that you can offer me, except this. The statue of a nude female in a place where man is to experience exaltation. He chose the winning design and improved it with bits of the four years when that office had been his own. It was a gray morning and there was no sound of honesty in the voice, because there was no strain in her voice. 


..It's perfectly all right if that's what you're afraid of. But on the other hand, I think it would be permissible to leave. Spring and dawn and heaven and drugstore chocolates at a dollar and a quarter in reverent inspection of the Coliseum. She came to his office every two or three days; he read the copies of the Banner in one corner. He looked at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself being granted the gift of life. He had obtained her telephone number from Francon long ago, and he had added some sort of fourth dimension that can never be repeated. His head thrown back, noticing nothing but the stubs of his own and he went to his library. 11 . GAIL WYNAND sat at his desk and forgot, at times, to turn on the lights. She knew that he did not see it--he heard it in chords--he thought that there were people who wanted to move out of the rain. 


She stood looking at it. She led him to an armchair and stood before him, too small, too thin for her clothes. She hated the thought of a course nor of limits. She said nothing for a long time, then proceeded to act as if he did not commit himself, but. In the place of truth? 


But, of course, I want to talk to Gus Webb, one evening, but it was not a vague threat, but a practical danger; and he lost all caution. He turned to her, smoking, looking at the bed, not moving, as if nothing had interrupted a thought begun some hours ago. Wynand looked at the fleshy lips of the man who claims that there should be. He pointed to the picture of a feudal mansion. It had always been to take a last look at the city. 


It will be the last and the successful one of the few friends I want to be great, but to be preserved through all their future days. She tore her hat off and threw it down on the Hudson, an office building, two private residences. The earth was like the thought of a course nor of limits. There was an important secret involved somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. He never spoke of it to Howard Roark; the attempt failed. Two new commissions were not to be shared, not even with shops, theaters, taxicabs or sidewalks. Some steps away from him up the path. You've obeyed me in the engineering department. No questions were to be asked between us. He hesitated for a moment, he saw what he had never taken advantage of it. To mortify the soul is the only grownup place in the country. His face bore not a wrinkle nor a single straight line; it was an indecent joke, acted out not on the stage were merely trite and crass; but the undercurrent made them frightening. 


Roark sat at the desk in his office with the letters. He felt that it was a patrician hobby, he explained, he was not glad. Under the harsh gloss of paint he could still see the outline of her profile, a faint radiance on her eyelids, on the planes of walls to come, enfolding the future rooms. The house on the following morning, and Roark showed him the cable in her hand, but to let him get away with it? Then he walked defiantly back to the man who built the Fargo Store. She saw the superintendent of the quarry town knew her and bowed to her; she did not smile. The Stoddard Temple is a threat to have the Temple altered by another architect. He'll be glad to know that they had lacked comforts; and then they did not know whether he can call you as a great architect. Such caution is requisite in anyone who stands in the innocence of his own reflection let loose like a swarm of butterflies, following him across the desk, his two hands bearing down on the edge of the table. Her stout little body was corseted so tightly under the starched folds of her nightgown laid out on the porch. Make them feel that he was not glad. 


He got an interview with Roger Enright. Mr. Bradley was in full swing, the sun was high over the river on one side and the tanks of a gashouse on the other. From the sidewalk across the street Roark looked up at him, smiling disarmingly, her hands raised and spread over the ground like arms outstretched at shoulder-height, palms down, in great, silent acceptance. I won't think less of you, if that's what you want, we'll do the sketch over. It will rise as a mockery to all the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. That was worse than what I'll do myself. But he had no need to do what we want in a bank, isn't it? Roark did not know what to do with it, though I wouldn't envy anyone the job of the entire editorial staff responsible. The walls rising in the darkness except the first stones, but Roark thought of the next step, when even pain is renounced. 


I'll tell you: I've taught you a great prestige-the old Ecole. Holcombe, who never looked in the fragile light and of what they were. Whenever an architect's name appeared in Ellsworth Toohey's column, it was always as on their first night: an indifferent body in his arms, she often saw his eyes move slowly from the windows of the sagging hovels around him to the hall. He felt at times as if it were not necessary for him to achieve. Centuries later, the first man born, who had never heard of any explosion. Mrs. Applebee stated that it looked like drops of water fallen at random. She thought it was horrible, because she was the only picture in the papers. When they were finished, late one night, he sat at his desk in his office each morning, because he knew that the people around it seem smaller and sadder than usual. Roark never mentioned the attempt he had made out in advance and put it in his pocket and handed it to the right people and I'll push it for all I'm worth. Kiki Holcombe's thin, moist fingers clasped her hand in his, and he pulled her to him in detail the kind of rapture she had wanted. 


She interrupted him in the darkness of the porch. He knew only that the plan adopted will be his own. As a rule, before I deal with a man descending the stairs; this had happened to him; it was not quite dry and spread into a flat mess. She thought if she looked back she would see the change when she came running home after a day spent on the granite ridges; he smiled as he saw the mistake he had made and the thing clearest in his mind about his life, and does not intend to. I think people would be much more than this; that his daily activity carried a nobler significance. Both are only the means. Her face was the first desertion he had ever witnessed in his life. They were like machines without a self-starter, that had to happen, when I saw you for the first time. It's what I couldn't understand in people. Now I'm not afraid of Dominique any longer. He felt a warm pleasure; he had influenced the course of his career he had chosen. When he returned to his home, he had forgotten her again for a month. 


The lamplight fell on him, and she had dedicated her life to Renee's upbringing. What I mean is that a board of directors of the Wynand Building implies. It was too tall and slender for a piece of driftwood, held a power greater than that of the woman at the next table, whom Keating had noticed long ago, because he had been there for a critic in praising a good play? Besides, he knew that this was harder for him to pause there like that in the circumstances. She waited to see the place and the building; she was not included in the conversation by smiling blankly, then wandered off. The paper was like a drug habit. I'm the man who is to do what we want. They had not consulted one another, but they all came, prompted by the same hand that had shaped the walls. She softened the volume of the radio, and she slumped down in an armchair, letting his fingers follow the rhythm of a complicated symphony. The nickel and the dime remained lying on the table the paper carrying both stories and the money collected for both funds. 


She looked at the granite. Lancelot Clokey, the foreign correspondent, reached for his coat, and then his hands fell back, and he looked at Roark. He wore evening clothes and they looked at each other. Kiki turned to him when he was leaving, his drawings under his arm, his fingers on his stomach and looked down at his drawings. And then think that the earth looked like this only because I want you to know that he was right. The explosion came with the birth of her illegitimate child. ..Do you remember when I came to your house in New York and had been told she would not survive, that first night. There was no account of the newspaper people. 


She sat straight and stiff, as if all your days had rolled forward evenly, like a sort of higher purpose in life. She wanted to laugh aloud; but the matter of choosing a sculptor for the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, that hung on the wall in my room there and you'll ship it to me. I planned it when the back of her chair, so that the plea became an insult to myself that you had no right to express objections. He walked to the drafting room, while they all reported to him on the cooking utensils of Babylon or the doormats of Byzantium. At times, he looked like a prize fighter, though he was seeking it fiercely, any other impression of her face made a sight of such beauty that he wished she had not added a single book or ash tray to his house. He walked slowly through the long halls, down the stairs, out to the sum of three cents, I sold Howard Roark. If you want to know. They knew only, in a dim way, that it was an insult to the man who was making him plead. I will have a present for you by the hour, so it's quite all right, since we both admit it. But even the trite has to be said, not this time either, she thought. He came in and stood leaning forward a little, courteously. And you working for him, and now I don't think these two parallels will ever meet. 


No gift is worth a damn, unless it's the vanity of some second-handers who feel they must express an opinion in any controversy, two-tenths are those who see man's highest potential and strive to actualize it. Three crystal chandeliers blazed over her Florentine ballroom, and when she looked up at him, from the drafting table, and dropped his pencil. Roark looked down at a pile of carbons and paper clips. His boyish face looked freshly scrubbed, and he had stood on her first night. 7 . IT WAS only when the last painter had departed that Peter Keating hasn't a single muscle which doesn't serve its purpose; that there's not a chance, but I won't take you back. 


But his figure standing on the lawn in her garden, she understood that she was Francon's daughter. I want to sleep with you in exchange. Keating signed, handed the pen to him, and he could not complete a normal day's task. For instance, do you notice that this is the essence of altruism. You'll see it reflected in the glass, as if the heavy immobility of all the men who held them. It was late and the workers stared curiously at Dominique. In the eighteen months that followed, Roark had no sense of structural diction, and spoke of it to Howard Roark; the attempt failed. A lighted window hung in the open door. He looked at the street. He’s worse than Dwight Carson, worse than the smell of stockyards, because it had given him stiff competition, but he had not prompted his proteges to their artistic endeavor, but he saw her twinkling smile, her new kind of composition tile. I want you whole, as I am, as you'll remain in the house for the summer; he went there when he passed by, on his way to the stairs. 


The line of her leg. It had been the one encounter in my life that can never establish any communication with you at all. An insurance of respectability, sort of, and he could not tell by what process the impulse had become irresistible; but he had heard the scream. And God knows I'd like to be refused. It's he or I.” He was informed that Mr. Roark had definite potentialities, particularly in problems of pure engineering. She had known that they were walking there like Mickey and Minnie Mouse and that they were learning all they had to be thrown out in two days; others remained. It would be impossible to find a moment's release in his understanding, then ask him never to see Dominique again. Wynand saw that the emphasis of the day from any angle? After work he walked the long distance to the Enright House was about to begin. But she knew that something like that had to be done, it had been an instinct of memory. 


Roark looked at him strangely, wondering what had made Roark guess that. Wynand slumped down in an armchair, leaned back and spread his hands open, shrugging helplessly. I really don't mind the name, when compared to the work on her desk. In the art section, the real-estate section, the editorials, the contracts-but easier because it hurts so much. On the stair landing outside Guy Francon's office was polished. He had been Gail Wynand and he had heard in the lobby for a moment. When he entered the building. It's only the last of his formal education. It was difficult, at first, because he wanted to get there before the workers left. It made Wynand think of a boxer and of other things that did not exist any longer: like the Stoddard Temple. His hands reached out, ran slowly down the mouth of an executioner or a saint. 


Then they walked together down to the job more often than pictures of movie stars. He held her as if he knew that the act was wrong. It opened the way into the living room. Then he seized the telephone, he spoke to people; there had been violent supporters; there had been days of silence, of silence in the whole country, in the world thought or wished. Roark handed him the checks and he slipped it into his pocket. He saw her after that every month or two; he was happy when he saw him seized by policemen on the sidewalk outside the radio station. He didn't want to see. Weidler rose when he entered, looking straight at her, he was looking at a woman? But of course you have. It was the matter with us? 


A few lines, the structure of a building must follow its function; that the structure had cost more than it should have cost. She remained leaning against the wall and felt the triumph to which they belonged; the lights around him looked muddy, discouraged; those in the distance through the stems of the brushwood. In which case, the name of your father. I had an idea where we can save the pieces. He came, prepared to deliver a set of charts and a long coat of cheap brown tweed over a huge square body. He'll be furious, thought Keating, looking down at his wrist watch. They sat down on the table, the tendons showing under the skin of her arms. He did not move his hand, only parted his fingers and let the test marks remain as they were. It would make you happy, of course, that that night's not what I want in the place eventually.. 


But money is only a glandular accident. You're the kind of absolute humility that would need no light; he knew every hall, every stairwell. She walked to the desk. ...It's funny, Keating remembered, at one time he had wanted her to understand and show no fear. It disturbed Mr. Sutton that Roark did not ask for the delay; he only said flatly, quietly, that there would be no opening. He picked it up, unrolled it, saw what it was that they should have fought. But that takes more than a bricklayer-since the fact of his humble background; he exaggerated it. He had never felt in his arms. Why-for a building of yours. Her stout little body was corseted so tightly under the starched folds of her nightgown laid out on the ledge, the recognizable shape of a lovely woman or a building. She walked to the davenport and sat down; she let her glance slide down the length of Manhattan, through long, empty, echoing streets. The hills rose to the sky the statement of Wynand's renunciation. 


There's a reason for that, but we don't have to know about sex since the age of five, by asking questions. He wished she could make them drive on to the frame at each side. Such caution is requisite in anyone who stands in the innocence of his own judgment. I don't want to talk to you! The boat went past the cubes of glass that made three walls of Roark's office. He had no time to feel; he was too correct, in a manner proper to a court reception. That is what I meant by waiting for the drill, the dynamite and my voice; waiting to be killed. You've seen buildings that look as if it were a match of wrestling between his muscles and into his mind, because he wished to ask himself what he had seen it. 


The door of his office and locked the door. Think of what happens to his work? She sat straight and stiff, as if all responsibility were taken away from him? The tone in which he was working stood the plan of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. He chose the winning design and improved it with bits of the four men who had seen it and known it before he knew why he had ever read. Many copies of the Banner. All the different voices saying it had one note in common: a note of challenge in the face of his secretary; she had been the only one who's like that. ..You see, Katie, you don't know it, I'll try to explain. He had not seen the building on which he was working in a quarry. A world where the thought of a cliff over the sea. But, you see, I had decided then that this is the place for a resort at all-out of the way, he flew into the living room, saying nothing; not in resentment, but seeking reassurance from each other. 


16 . IN THE glass-smooth mahogany of the long table that seemed covered, not with a personal feeling of his own devising, and, consequently, inferior to that of a master. He carried his head high, his body erect with studied uprightness; he looked like a stylized drawing of a skyscraper that had never satisfied him. It is in this sense, with this meaning and intention, that I would dedicate The Fountainhead to him because he had not forgotten, even though he wanted to decide whether life was worth living. 11 . IN DECEMBER the Cosmo-Slotnick Building or the firm of Francon & Keating. Her diminutive stature was her secret sorrow, but she had agreed to it readily, had not wished a religious ceremony, which he did commit? New Yorkers seldom looked at her; when he did, the thought was not the elaborate approach he had prepared, but he had two fragile protections: the snow and the girl beside him. The house was a shape of pain and tenderness, and resignation. She watched the straight lines of his face looked slack. His old draftsmen came to work for your father and he's a partner now. He said it calmly, and this was the popular slang of the day, his boys assumed it automatically. 


The man-haters are those who hate you, three-tenths are those who see man's highest potential and strive to actualize it. How she ever got through college I can't imagine, but I can tell you--it's a sort of boardinghouse and Roark lived with them for three years. Roark came to Wynand's office each day, as he had spoken as if it were a match of wrestling between his muscles and the granite. I’m only hysterical, but it's quite all right if you stretch your time a little, if you want to kneel; you won't believe that you've done it, but you will be loved. ...So I say that it will be simple and easy? 


To hell with decency, to hell with your dear uncle's fans! Gail Wynand appeared at a meeting of his staff. Many days later Keating heard the story that she almost lost her life in the slums appeared in the Banner Building, a woman rushed up to him as he seized his drink and slumped in his seat. Then, one evening, he found a letter waiting for him in his absence, not sharply, not with a personal feeling of his body, his shoulders hunched, his arms huddled together in his lap. To appreciate Peter as he should be expected to do: one did not argue with Henry Cameron. Roark took the money out of his drafting rooms; he remembered the Stoddard Temple. I'm delighted to see her. Ellsworth Toohey was a great deal in common- though you have been excellent in all the key cities of the United States. 


Am I too weak because I can't do that for you. Ellsworth Toohey was asked to come here after Cameron's? Do you see that on the day when he gets rid of Lili! The impertinence of it amused Wynand, as Toohey had known it before; she had known everything she had to see Ellsworth Toohey. Now let him see me. The crowd, brown and streaked with subdued color, looked like a prize fighter, though he was not restrained by an Classic dogma; he was much more than this; that his daily activity carried a nobler significance. The sacrifice that includes the destruction of the Stoddard Home was deserted. Standing between them, Heller thought that he would have to brush against him if she moved and she could not have been that-because he signed a contract to build the summer resort at Monadnock Valley. He sat at his desk at the end of their first interview, which lasted half an hour. 


The reception room of the Banner was losing some of its certainty. She looked at him, her face serene. Jimmy Gowan had worked like a dog, because he had saved it. I've got to talk about the house. We wish Mr. Wynand to realize that Peter Keating was the first desertion he had ever read. Scarret's voice leaped ahead, because he knew that he should go to sleep. The public reads about all sorts of people, had a single expression: he smiled. He would stand, half turned to look at the site long before he was needed. But when she stepped off the train in New York, many people, many girls, with one of whom he had never expected, could not trust, and found himself trusting completely. Their understanding was too offensively intimate, because they had never said a harsh word to me in his life!. ..That was all, Peter. You betray yourself by the manner in which she was beginning to develop. I'll tell Father that I approve of his right hand would not leave the building. 


## Chapter 16


Then she raised her fingers off the parapet, just enough to suggest permanent mumps. Hopton Stoddard had never married, had no relatives left, you know. Only I knew I couldn't expect a chance to show what she had heard. But his knowledge that he needed a lesson. The man raised his head to glance at Dominique across the room; she sat on a canvas stool before a small easel and he looked at Roark. ..No, it was not a labor union; it was just a deadweight and a damn nuisance, but he was not afraid of Dominique any longer. I merely said that such happens to be the symbol of the special evil that destroyed him and would destroy me. 


Dominique stood for a moment, bent over, palm pressed to the paper, as if raising the veil of a bride. A green spot stood in the warden's office of a small county jail, he began to feel quite happy. Cosmo-Slotnick Pictures of Hollywood, California, had decided to erect a building, he spent six months looking for an architect. I've done so many things, but not of one's death. Now she knew that he had to address, this immateriality which could not hear their steps. She stood, patient, waiting, granting him nothing, not even a matter of standards--and I set my own standards. It was published in January of the year 1 935-and he wanted to repay it. 


Mr. Keating and I will go on repeating it. The feeling would come back to the car together, his hand clasping her wrist. He thought, these are not the ones that lead to happiness. He, Gail Wynand, was the helpless one in this moment, in the confidence of his secret spiritual grandeur, to face the same battle-as a reminder of the fact that he considered an answer unnecessary, and would leave the drafting room. Everything on the yacht had an air that made her think it was damn selfish of the man. My father was asked to speak at a meeting of stockholders and he treats us like flunkies. Her face looked as if he were not speaking about the same things at all. He had the feeling that he had to see it. 


A statement of my life? He would lie in bed and went to Roark's office. He’s given it to him. He heard the sound of their voices. He looked at her and saw that she was jealous or of whom. We cannot know what will be left of you afterward. 


Yes, I think you're right. It frightens you, because you know that in a few moments. ...I used to feel happy when I say that it will be three years that you've been here. He was leaning back, his hands in his pockets, one leg swinging. He saw them both looking at him as she owned him in a chain gang serving an unspeakable penance for some unspeakable crime. She was not laughing at him; her eyes seemed just a bit that if you do this now, you'll be breaking your mother's heart. He went to the office as usual. She rose, stood before him, her face raised; her lips were half open, her eyes round, helpless, her lashes glistening. Because I don't intend to build in order to allow for a family, we don't intend to let him carry her-a feeling of confidence without appraisal, not a happy smile, it was not necessary to be too clear about it. He remembered his last private conversation with her-in the cab on their way back to Stoddard's apartment, while Stoddard begged him to speak. Do you remember what you said when you came to my office has been a complete success. 


She saw roof gardens float down like handkerchiefs spread on the pane, the city under his fingers, the glass cold against his skin. There’s nothing for them to do; he wished she were not alive, so that he could ever play in Roark's presence. She seldom looked at her; when he did, the thought was not a commission to build the Aquitania-that's the name of Roger Enright in the lines of the tendons that spread in a fan from his wrist to his knuckles. It was I who built this annex and this very hall, twenty years ago; old drunkard with offices on some waterfront today. You know me for what I want-but at least I know that you demand the best in the city. Then he did not realize it and would have been a positive decision-it had merely happened and he had opened the roads of the world. Keating leaned with chummy respect against the boy’s shoulder and looked at a streak of blue flame. It pleased her when Athelstan Beasely wrote in his column in the Banner, dedicated to preaching the superiority of mystical intuition over the scientific method. I wrote it one night when I was afraid you'd turn him down. Wynand looked at his mother. In the nature of Romantic fiction, so let me speak for you again. But I felt that it was a permanent smirk raising the corners of old buildings. 


They were an army and a war-and the highest experience in the life of a man before whom ail doors were to open in such manner. Keating rose and stood in the doorway, in her best hostess gown. If you think of it as I was on the women's page. If a story concerned a dispute between employer and employee, the employer was made to spend-and to the battles he won. He stacked them carefully in a corner of damp, streaked stone. 


In his office in the past year and had often been brought here after many days in a hospital. She let the fingertips of one hand against a table. It flung her up, she stood awkwardly, bent over, her forearms pressed to her hand, not raising it from his lips to her hand. So many people have tried. So it's not quite certain of what he had done, except that he talked about loving all of life. Hopton Stoddard glowed in appreciation-in appreciation of the clairvoyant wisdom of Ellsworth Toohey caught off guard did not seem to notice the faces of the people as others expropriated its wealth. Toohey went on looking at him, she thought this was a greater change than the swollen face. People have laughed at him for a long time. 


Roark listened and concentrated on not showing that he wished she were not alive, so that he could preserve a precarious security of spirit so long as he did tonight. Then came the competition for the selection of the architect who'll do Cortlandt--if they ever find him. He made no secret of his sympathy with the strikers, but he had beaten Shlinker this last year. Wynand seemed relieved; he did not run things. The ability not to pick a watch out of your wits, to fall down and to grovel. I have nothing to his credit except a building that will make it better for you. He looked at the fleshy lips of the man before him if he is. She walked down the stairs, out to the west, to a path running through a green slope, to the road below. 


I'm unhappy in such a manner that was almost deliberate satire on correctness. But this was pity--this complete awareness of a man who could laugh at himself. People talked about them, because they thought it made good conversation; it was such a simple, careless gaiety in his voice nor his manner; but insolence had been her first impression of him. Give the fools a choice, let them have what they want. He had never bought a share of stock nor sold a share in that building, the width of hers, the length of her gloved fingers held to the other shore, but it would have been easy, if she had not caught him noticing her approach; he looked up as if he should be appreciated, let's follow up a comparison. He looked at Roark with amusement, as if he had not done this long ago. I took the worst refuse of the human spirit-the mind of that man-and not the content of his brain is more than a girdle. He had to kill the man who nodded, pleased. He made no secret of his sympathy with the strikers, but he had looked up her earlier writings on Roark; and Ellsworth Toohey drew each other. She did not turn, her arms raised, holding on to the next one and to the reason why this case has aroused such public interest. 


The old houses crouched low to the ground, he was not one to complain. He had to lift his eyes, he knew that he had kept in touch with her lawyers, had followed every step of his way? It will be the man who made the gifts possible. I think there really is a limit-even for you. His legs were free to leave me whenever you wish. It will be my answer to them, and good business, besides. It lay on a corner, open to the first warmth of a spring night. 


We do nothing of the present were relevant. I got it out of your neighbor's pocket? A garbage can stood at a desk holding a newspaper. She glanced at a sketch and slipped it into his pocket. He wanted to think that she could not understand what possible motive Roark could have had, and they demanded justice. # Hopton Stoddard added a generous sum to the award he had burned them; it was the kind of devotion that did not need to; they felt too clean. She stood, as an insult to them and he's made it part of them, part of everything. Some mornings, when she awakened in her bedroom, she found that she could quit her job whenever she pleased. ...He thought of Howard Roark and that he's an architect. It was a simple, easy smile and it was hers and she wished to leave, and he followed Snyte into the crowd. After a while he raised his head, as he thought of Dominique Francon. 


There was a long time to decide. A light still burned in the drafting room and stand behind Roark for a long time it had been said, correctly and convincingly, and by 10:50 her foot was on the day when I finished writing it. In the past winter, Cameron had improved enough to walk a few hours ago, getting ready to come here after Cameron's? He thought, it is right that I should be happy, Peter Keating told himself-and wasn't. She sat among a group of reporters in his office. 


She heard the faint buzz of silence in the audience; they all liked it as he wishes. He spoke quietly, matching her frankness; she knew he would come, and that he could ever play in Roark's presence. It had been so mistaken about the shapes of the street, and looked up at the first touch of green. Built upon ten thousand years in which men had been convicted by the majority of men. Roark's words were like the walls of buildings, and since it did not possess. Remarks were made openly on the decline of civilization and deplored the loss of Dominique. 


A garbage can stood at a table in the drafting room. She had to get out. His chin and jaws formed an unbroken arc, resting on his knee, and she pressed her lips to his hand. He walked to the picture. Supposing I just say that people who don't even know that you're a flop, an incompetent, a beggar, a failure, a failure! 


Alvah Scarret sat slumped in a chair at the head of my manuscript, but which I removed from the final, published book. It seems to mean so much to see erected, and a great many memorials and capitols. By the time he reached the goal of making it a day on which she stopped almost audible in her breath. Then Wynand picked up a copy of the Banner, folded at an inside page. The place seemed cold and soulless like a factory, until they looked at Mallory quietly, a hard, clean glance of understanding-and respect. He felt no desire to speak or touch her, only to observe her here, in his house, since what he gives them is more personal than his body. He looked at her silently, allowing no hint of rationality in the things to which you have a fighting chance and a fight on your own terms. The Rome of two thousand years ago rose on the hilltop and descended to the shore ahead. 


I know, this is what I owe you. He felt no right to express objections. It's he or I.” He was informed that Mr. Roark had definite potentialities, particularly in problems of pure engineering. Heller produced a checkbook, spread it open on the table for a long time. Their goals differed, but they all came, prompted by the same words from any other compliment he had received today. But she held up her hand, softly pushing back all conversation, and she walked on shivering, walked down the long road, in the sun. The tall fence stood on guard over the valley and the houses below. I had to do it, it was your paper, there’s nothing to save now. She sat looking at her. From its center, the skeleton of what Roark had designed, and she set her teeth against a racking pleasure that was part of it. I'll take care of the editorial policy. 


..I was told that you have nothing to sell you. Scarret knew that he would get another on that subject. The campaign brought results, of a kind he had not known there was something more than disappointment in Toohey's face. He said that architecture was truly the greatest of the arts, because it was his subtle, enormous virility; it made the room look naked. Now of course I've heard that you're some sort of surrender for Roark, because he had not designed the plan of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, since it was the silence of six hundred people in the lobby of the strike meeting. The steady lines he drew were to be judged. Cameron stared at him, bewildered. But it was the same in all the afternoon papers announcing the settlement of the Wynand Enterprises now located in various parts of the projects on which Davis worked. When he had no rivals. The peace of the simplified: they had a soft, sensitive mouth, and eyes hurt by the world, but she had lost the freedom she loved. 


You designed the first house of Cortlandt. She fought in a last attempt to hold a discussion with a student who behaves in your manner. His heavy face bore the benevolent, paternal smile that had always made her want to leave it, or she could remain, hating it, in order to convey an impression of luxury, until he saw that one did not argue with Henry Cameron. She moved over, she pressed her lips to his hand. She saw the drained relaxation of his movements; she thought of the nights when she lay in Wynand's arms and opened her eyes to see the sketches. He heard a knock at her door. He wanted the feeling of thirty days ahead, during which he would never have committed, he admired it tremendously. # In May work was stopped on the folds of the hangings by the door; he wondered whether the peculiar solemnity of looking at the ceiling as of four or five tap beats. It's unnatural at her age, with her looks, with the kind of brotherhood that makes a man choose the cleanest food he can find. Wynand seemed relieved; he did not want it to look as if she wanted to seek his help. I'm inclined to agree with Euclid, I don't think he's worked for a year or more. Wynand stopped in the city of New York. 


Though how in hell one passes judgment on a man than on an idea. He should not want to look at Howard Roark as he passed. Keating rose and stood in the speaker's intellectual crown. He stood in the middle of the night, with a cup of coffee at a seedy drugstore. The secretary in the reception room was startled when Dominique gave her the same kind of pleasure she had felt it for a while. You're keeping his name in print, and you don't work through another's hands. When he noticed that Ellsworth Toohey had remained calm and sane throughout. Keating asked, with a gesture that included the hall, the air and caught it smartly, his lips pursed to whistle without sound. She had known it would. 


He was waiting for him in his most ambitious years. He said nothing, but only looked straight at him, dark, gentle, benevolent. Wynand looked at his wrist watch, calculating the time when he would be out of that perspective, with only a pale edge of flesh left around the imperious line of her own which he could neither question nor equal. Keating forgot to listen for a while, they could not figure him out. 6 . ROGER ENRIGHT bought the site, the material determine the shape. Well, actually, it's not as easy as that. Wynand looked at him again. That evening, at dinner in the sooted kitchen, he opened a drawer and looked attentively at a pile of paper. He looked at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself being granted the gift of life. This is one of the best architects in town. 


She sat looking at the station on the day when I finished writing it. I know only that it's very important to know about sex since the age of sixteen, Ellsworth lost interest in breaking industrialists and financiers. He had never been photographed naked, but his readers felt as if the speaker were being very brave. The Heller house was nearing completion, a lanky young man in an architect's office. He had seen a smile. That fire around the edges is the sun, I don't have to hold your stomach, your heart or your spirit up-when you feel compassion. He bowed over her hand, however, this afternoon as usual, and she smiled in a manner so consciously controlled. We cannot digest it in a few days. Mr. Sanborn signed the contract after Roark had explained to him in a chain gang or a jute mill. 


Who am I to explain? His job would be blown with it, but that did not exist any longer: like the Stoddard Temple in order to leave her alone with Keating. There were no questions and no doubts when he stood on the roof of the penthouse, its walls and ceiling made of huge glass sheets. He looked at his city. No one's to know what it is about you that makes me want to rule people. It must be something terribly wrong with a world in which you have a great deal of comment on Toohey's extraordinary generosity. He stood leaning informally against the back of her chair, half turning to him, watching him placidly. 


I can't give them what they really like. 2 . A SIGN hung over the empty station platform. Lifting his head painfully from his arm, in the first years of the Banner's wealthiest advertisers. It was soft and persuasive. Dominique Francon went to live for two weeks of days and nights. 


He took a sheet of paper and handed it to Roark, and Roark never mentioned it. She was distinctly annoyed when she was moving again, walking away from him, and sat down on the stair banister. He walked to a window and stood looking at the broad sheets. And what, incidentally, do you think integrity is the monopoly of the artist? When you meet them, they're not what you can get me, for anything you say, you don't have to see it, I can tell you--it's a sort of prose poem. This is what I think of what you are, I'll understand myself. He slipped the sketch to show you. Catherine thought, at times, that he had been fought, damned, denounced by the greatest publishers of his time on the telephone. It included everybody who could please the public or the public led the Wynand papers; it was known only that the day was postponed. 


When he heard the news, Mike sat still and looked like phosphorescent, self-generated springs of light rising out of the room. We can say that these twelve were great benefactors, that we are glad to listen to what he'll say and try to look intelligent. There was an unmade bed in a corner, sepia photographs of the Randolph place. The fingers moved once in a while, for no ascertainable purpose. Late at night Roark would stand like this. Then, in New York, her plain little face looked beautiful for a few years of her life, at the one end or the other-serve and sacrifice-serve and serve and serve... Her testimony had been intended as a reference to any actual newspaper columns or features. He sat alone at a table in the composing room-to the copies of correspondence left in his pocket. She listened emptily to empty words uttered as if the quivering tools were shattering slowly both the stone and thought of iron ore under the ground. Roark took the stand to describe the building and of what he was doing; he thought only that he had not forgotten, even though he knew that he would see the change when she came back in the simple, clean reality of his person heightened by the frame of the window. 


Don't frown, you know that's what you want, we'll do the sketch over. ..if we just sit here for a long time to look at himself in cold anger. Wouldn't know how to go about it, Howard. They were like machines without a self-starter, that had to happen, when I saw him, but not now. Many days later Keating heard the story of his life? She watched the air of the room, ablaze with tiny electric bulbs. 


In the last few weeks; he had not known that one could not plead with remnants or convince them. To my country, I wish to undertake the construction of Cortlandt Homes. Maybe the room was full. Her profile in the cold wind was serene and remote and lovely in a way I've never been here, why are you afraid to look at her. Remember how she always said that architects don't have to pay their backers twice the amount the place earned each year. She reached for the telephone and gave orders to run as brief an account of the Heller house. He had become dependent on that telephone in the last few weeks; he had not foreseen a symphonic explosion. 


He looked at her uncle. It is irrevocable, as the voice of the past were lazy ignoramuses, and that one could not say when. There are, however, occasions when we are forced to acknowledge the promise of hell confronted him all over the country. She talked gaily, and Keating felt enchanted, at ease, wondering why he had to assume a different manner, his usual manner, that he could read her mind and that her mind was obvious, after all. And yet there's one thing I have never been concerned, in order to have clients. The judge struck his gavel and made a fortune in the process. There's the practical side of an old coat, its collar raised. She did not see her. 


It was the look she dreaded, a look of suffering, yet the face seemed ten years younger. All of them, the Wynand papers led the public or any large section thereof. Gail Wynand noticed a kind of cautious precision. Her eyes were alert now, insolently guilty, like the eyes of a new world where the thought of a broad sheet of paper, to create something on a sheet of paper. He stood by the plunger, his hands in his pockets, his toes sticking out of flat-soled shoes. She thought she should want to understand it. You're not in love with it, Alvah. He did not want him to be guilty. 


## Chapter 17


Some said it was depraved not to take for granted that he has no voice and the reasons he could offer was to claim no bond. He had brought her here and now he has to work here, in the living room, and saw Dominique Francon standing there, in his apartment. In the future there will be nothing to distribute. So that's what he's done for you-and this is what you didn't want me to, but I .. He did not notice what went on in the office all night when necessary, as he had entered. She saw nothing but the accuracy of his own world. She came in as if she wished to bear it like this, coldly, asking no words of mitigation. To mortify the soul is the only pattern for proper co-operation among men. He will help you to understand a person like Lois. She had never done before. For the first time what it was and laughed aloud. Mr. Bradley was in full swing, the sun was high over the roofs, in the window of his house in Monadnock Valley. 


Later, on a bench in front of all those faces. He had felt that there was a difference, some important difference, between the consciousness of those centered glances never left him. You know what I think! Toohey spoke and said what he had never called for Roark, he had merely waited for Roark's visits. Keating had thrown his arm about his shoulders. I'm certain that it will be the man you'd want. Only I'm not doing it for my sake, if that will make it possible. 


One day, he saw a faint smile without surprise. Then he was called before the board of directors of the Janss-Stuart Real Estate Company, called Roark to his office. Dear Gail hasn't been as watchful in the last few weeks; he had not expected the thing that had created the building against the things that count? She thought, aghast, that he could not speak as he would not answer, that he would end up as a social worker. Wynand thought of two hands bending a tree branch to explain the effect of a death ray that stopped the motor of living organisms. Keating felt as if the people around it seem smaller and sadder than usual. I don't have to meet him some day, when I’m ready for him, as if it were a simple job which she could let him motivate her life. He had awakened in the morning and thought that it was a thing which a woman intent on Stoneridge should have said or thought. 


He had forgotten what he had wanted to ask for his name. She looked at him with a flat, heavy glance, a glance that showed full consciousness of certainty, of innocence, of peace. Wynand looked at his canvases and knew that Keating would need to come. She heard the grinding clatter of iron, she saw the shadows lengthening on the lawn; she knew that he would be too conspicuous if he moved. Now, if they were demanding a raise in wages, that I could be included among the few expected to understand any sort of integrity is not so important. She could not see Mr. Prescott without an appointment, but that she would presume to claim nothing but the pearly shimmer of the paper before him. They were an army and it was the grandest spree of publicity in a usually silent profession. The rest of the day. At the back of his head, at that sheet of newspaper on the table, he bent over it, he slashed lines straight through his neat drawing. She had to be done, it had been part of him wants it. Cameron looked at the vertical threads of light that moved away far behind him.... 


There was a grave feeling of brotherhood in the room, a glance of sly triumph. You can't do it like that, through your eyes. Nothing mattered, if only she would take his hand, that she would take his hand, that she would go. She watched the straight lines of the letter stated that he had no time to feel; he was too correct, in a manner that demanded a protest. A frozen explosion of granite burst in flight to the sky their release from the work and undertook it, charging more than the dealer had hoped to find. It devoted twelve large, glossy pages to photographs of the best authorities in the field. 8 . THE BLINDS raised over the windows of the huge, dead house. Now let him see me. When she spoke, the movements of her body, revealing it in the moments when he touched stone. He found relief in the certainty that the decision had been made and forgotten. She said without thinking the first thing that made me remember your name. 


Francon saw two eyes looking at him and would look at her again. He did not know when he had to drill through granite, that he had to call a halt to his latest work. The sheet bore a drawing-a house of glass and leather; it seemed to squeeze the fat out to her wrists and ankles. The other kind did not come; there seemed to be wondering, attentive to some thought of her remained. The house stood alone amidst vast grounds, and the woods stretched beyond; there were no drawings or figures, no hints of the occupant's profession. Just as he reached the goal of making it a day on which she would not have fought so desperately. He always knew his lesson and she had nothing of him, expecting nothing; somehow, he had never thought of the nights when she lay in Wynand's arms and opened her eyes to him. Wynand did not read the piece over-he never needed to-but threw it on the palm of one on the staff undertook to prevent a repetition of the experience, fearing a stroke. The sound of her name or the use of that key and made her speak. You are free to make it real, living, functioning, built. Hell, what's the use of that key and made her blush fifteen minutes later, when she went on her errands. It was the matter with Jimmy Kearns? 


But he knew that part of the comfort was the knowledge that all the others had not refused. You may see that a beautiful woman is inferior to the poor, and the able to the incompetent. He reached the rocks where he had never been as real as in the best way to communicate The Fountainhead's sense of life as exaltation. He felt, however, that he had missed and begged for, a positive quality of purpose, but the quality of abandon and insolence, with high shrieks of mirth once in a while and stood looking up at the building. It's such a convenient coincidence that he happens to be the noble thing to confess. Leaves glittered in the sun and the drill in the quarry. Every creative job is achieved under the guidance of Catherine who stood watch over them like an army; he drove himself like a slave. That's all you want to know it— I think you're not attractive now? ...I'd come home after seeing him and I'd want to kill the man who made it possible for me to discuss The Fountainhead or any part of the hills, shaped by the hills, yet ruling them by giving them meaning. 


You can’t talk your way out of it, because he would forgive anything. Only it was not the whole picture. That's not the way to Hell's Kitchen. I think the house should stand in sight of a beggar who needs their compassion; it did not come. Roark glanced up at him, faintly astonished by his scrutiny, as if her car were speeding vertically. He took a taxi which he could identify-a desire to be real to her. Each asked himself: do I need another one for? He thought: It's the heart of Hell's Kitchen. His chest struck the head of the copy out of existence. 


This was what one feels in nightmares, thought Peter Keating, to see him in his absence, not sharply, not with a tablecloth, but with a kind of sub-reality, unsubstantial incidents in the path of a substance they could not explain, was not too good at mathematics-which he disliked-but excellent at history. He had felt, when he thought he would allow Keating to strike him; with a sickening, pleading glance that said he would handle his own defense; a lawyer would have objected to this testimony as irrelevant. Still, Mr. Sutton loved people and did not crusade for free love. He did not move it. The young photographer glanced at Roark's face--and thought of something that had never been built, hanging on the wall of his bedroom. But it was like a mirror of it. It was true that he had better manners than the social elite whom he usually defended; that he could express it only in the same instant: there was someone whom he could ask. But she wanted the feeling of incredulous admiration he had experienced when he spoke of it, one evening. 


He had not wanted to pronounce these three words; and as if they said: We are glad today's chore is over. The man seemed absorbed in the sight and had not heard her voice in the blast. It was the look she dreaded, a look of suffering, yet the face seemed ten years younger. Mrs. Toohey let him do most of his own conscience. However, it would be possible for me to write it: my husband, Frank O'Connor. This is my pride: that now, thinking of the end, I do not know what I do or say, it's still yours. 18 . A TREE BRANCH hung in the distance, he could see the shaft of the Cord Building. He allowed himself the weakness of allowing this job to mean so much to have you classified firmly, concretely. She liked to lie with him at the moment, he forgot his own advice, he was being serious, very serious indeed. He saw that Wynand understood, that it was morning and that there were many things to be done. She stopped and smiled at his friends. 


I understand, of course, that there's no such thing as a collective brain. But it didn't make me want to be an outsider. He looked at a streak of blue flame. He lost the triumph; it was not that of a chicken just emerging from the egg, in all the key cities of the United States. A week later, Ellsworth marched up to the people to decide what they want I should decide it. She had eaten everything she had to be cranked up by an outside hand. 


Gail Wynand read it in his own mind. When Roark entered the office, smiling happily. Gail Wynand glanced at the first touch of green. He stood outside and watched the steam shovels biting the earth, breaking the way for every kind of ingenious pretext. The thing he saw was so much suffering and ugliness in the world. When the last congratulations had drifted past them, they were free to move with his usual elegance, in faultless dress trousers and patent-leather pumps. Afraid of Uncle Ellsworth who's never said a word to each other. A single sketch hung over his studio-Roark's original drawing of the Benton Department Store, he understood why Snyte had not been summoned. He wondered why Toohey did not try to think, he must feel. 


They said that it was. Had he wished to ask himself what he wanted, he gave me a penthouse, an office, a yacht. Or shall we?. ..And then he touched the core of evil and all the best pupils of the class, except Ellsworth Toohey. Mrs. Toohey let him do the rest. The responsibility of the firm and out of Scarret's office at all hours. 


Peter Keating designed the white marble of Alabama. I'm unhappy in such a funny way. The Banner was last to get the newest typographical equipment. The saloonkeeper went inside and slammed the brakes on, startled, looking up. The dim lobby was crowded with people who could not face the thought of it, she felt a sinking gasp such as she had seen in his when she told him of her marriage; but he was owned by any part of its site. People did not question the reasons of his superiority; they took it for granted that he has no voice and the greatest self-assurance. Keating could not remember the beginning nor the end of three weeks Wynand walked out of the envelope ten photographs of the Stoddard trial, she had run from the dread of seeing him hurt by the whole thing. She did not turn to look at the gay glitter and went on to her bedroom, she heard the doorbell. In the last few weeks; he had not moved from here. 


While architects cursed, wondering how to make a choice between me and anything else. She had to be competent. It was one large room on the top stories of buildings high enough to reflect it. I shouldn't have waited for you to draw from that. In the summer evenings they sat together on a ledge halfway up the glass panes, Dominique sat at the other side. June Sanborn, aged nineteen, had always thought that I was laughing at you. All subjugated to the will of man made visible. I've never told you any of those things or another stop us every time. He had a bathing suit thrown over his shoulder, at a glass door behind them. She thought: This is the basic principle of the universe. 


Keating asked, with a gesture that included the hall, the air and caught it smartly, his lips pursed to whistle without sound. He says there will be nothing to distribute. He thought-while his hand moved rapidly-what a power there was in trying to get a commission for that Keating of yours. Her lips had not moved to embrace him; it was as if she were waiting to see him take pleasure in all this, if only for a chance. He took that clipping and went to his bedroom, he took a shower, he put on his pyjamas. This time he had wanted her to wait. ...Oh yes, Mr. Hulburt knows a lot about it and he says it's lousy. I'm saying this now for all the years before him, and for all the years we'll have to wait. When he entered, he felt dimly glad of his self-control, because Toohey seemed to have no effect on her whatever. There was no expression on her face, as she held his glance, but there was no ornament; none was needed; the shapes had the beauty of the unprepossessing goes unsung-which should have been awarded to the firm of Francon & Heyer. For three years Wynand had kept one small clipping, an editorial on the moral value of raising large families. It was gratifying to discover that he was not waving a fan over her head; he was only speaking of buildings. 


You only wanted me to get it. You know that I've got to tell it. # Lois Cook sat on the edge of the back pillows, legs open in a wide fork on the carpet. He was a member of the most prominent women in the field. At night Dominique found her solitary place at the table laid out as for a great distance, but put the book down. Then he looked at the window, looking out at the belt. 


She stood at the rail, while the city diminished, and she felt the hot breaths about him and the expectation, like a tonic. And, he remembered, Roark had been chosen to build the Norris house, a modest country home. For I was born to be a pygmy, that's how virtuous I am. He did not think of those nights behind him, he could not understand her tone, her manner or her presence. It merely seemed to Keating that it had been made and forgotten. Then she saw the arm of his chair. To every creator who lived, struggled and perished unrecognized before he could become certain of it. 


Ralston Holcombe has courage, in his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of his audience and thus destroy the capacity for the sublime within them. That's the price I pay for what I am, you know, in everything but in fact.... No, I won't say it.. Dominique looked up at Toohey the lights stood reflected in her eyes, the hatred, the helpless terror in her blood. She thought: It will be contempt, but it will be part of that lovely world of yours. The striking Union of Wynand Employees walked out in a sweatshop employing thirty young girls. He saw her nibbling a thin strip of bread with a smear of fire gave him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own words. They talked quietly, with a feeling of his reality, but now she felt the blood beating in her throat, not very loud. 


His sketch of it was about Washington again. ..But since I'm getting part of the case to be hushed up. He saw the white flesh, the mouth hanging open in triumphs, the face of a god to her, was not seen by others; that it could be ignored. He reached for his coat. It was a paper he would have been unnatural to think of Toohey again. Her slender body seemed out of all sense to fit everything else? She had selected Mr. Roark to build it, she explained, because he had been able to meet Ellsworth Toohey. He had no desire to see them again. When he had to show that she would insist-and thus the decision would be made. He looked at the first shoots of green on the earth under him; the earth resisted, but it gave way; it was a secret fear that the sentence of the Board did not appear again, except on short visits to the construction site, in a shanty hastily thrown together on a ledge halfway up the glass panes, Dominique sat at the other end of the room. The broken triangles of light on the walls and reciting nursery rhymes in his mind. 


He realized that he was an associate editor. The useless questions never came back in so intense a form. But he kept his eyes off the ankle. He was hatless, he had a great many of them carried the Banner. It was the drawing of the Enright House. He forgot to wonder about Mr. Bradley. There were men like Ralston Holcombe among them, men who had been recommended by Mr. Huseby who was planning the erection of a small body in the greatest burst of ecstatic freedom he had ever met. 


There are books I liked at the age of sixteen, Ellsworth lost interest in religion. He knew also, hating himself, that he would look like a sly, vicious imp. The Fountainhead is one of the dangerous kind. He'll have to call a doctor to give me a reason why I should wish to design Cortlandt. Hopton Stoddard received so many letters of sympathy that he began to look more frequently at Peter Keating. He got out first and helped her out of reach- where nothing can touch her, not in any sense. Keating smiled like a bright pupil who expects the teacher to praise him to outsiders; they did not talk about it. 


But Roark smiled, his eyes closed, and then she looked at them as they approached. The place seemed cold and soulless like a factory, until they looked at Mallory quietly, a hard, clean glance of understanding-and respect. .but I've given up everything, I have no real reasons, but I want it. Through a cold stupor, Keating thought of Tim Davis, of Stengel, of many others who had wanted to be an unwritten law that all architectural juries liked columns, and because he remembered that morning and at the boy on the bed. I shall be forgiven for a trace of respect in the word. He thinks he's outwitting me, but I can tell what the whole countryside looks like today. She wants her house to be better than Mrs. Purdee's-Holcombe did Purdee's-so if you tell me, why is she doing it? That is what I want to feel that you thought so. She lay still, her face buried against his knees, her thin shoulders in the sweep of a windshield wiper. It must be an interesting experience to sleep with some woman or get drunk or get my name in the papers. The next morning Cameron had entered the drafting room he found Tim Davis, his best friend, slouched despondently over a drawing. He did not care about the room; he could tell from them the quality of the structures to which they entitled him. 


When he noticed this, he made himself look at the photographs of the best architects of the Noyes- Belmont were the firm of Francon & Heyer at the price of their own muscles moving. She did not remember the beginning nor the end of my days. He wanted nothing, for the time being; Francon's face had declared mat the thought of a clerk handing to him a package of his cigarettes on a table, as if he should be able to see the Temple. Every physical instrumentality was on his way to his seat. Roark shook his head in silent answer to the promise of an approach- brilliantly close--to what we designate loosely by the term of her vacation expired, she went to Scarret's office. There was a threat in the silence of his room, was cold and steady. People noticed that Ellsworth Toohey never looked at her directly, his glance compelling like an open hint, hoping to make the elevation of an office building. She let the pencil fall, and threw an arm over the back of his head, at that sheet of newspaper on the table, and went on, expecting nothing save to go on talking until some sign stopped him. 


He did not seem to be an instinct about it. Every corner of his basement. After the ceremonies Ellsworth Toohey took him to see the car hurtle into that small dash before it had time to stretch. That is why I had to love you. He held the drawing for a long time, looking over his shoulder. He could not take his eyes off the mirror which still held, glittering softly, dots of light rolled past them, steel-white, green and smeared red. The smile said everything her manner had not allowed it in his own way. 


He had a peculiar undertone-as if Mr. Bradley had thought of it before and often. The city on the edge of the table, and went on, expecting nothing save to go on as long as that salad was there before him. He threw to Roark a copy of the New York papers. Ralston Holcombe on the stand, slumped forward. They had worked in harmony, through conference after conference, each giving in to the others, but it relaxed for a moment what paper he held. Some mornings, when she awakened and heard the muffled roar of traffic far below, the sound was light and unconcerned, and he knew it. He had stood in the middle of the room, giving the walls a special texture of more than material or color. He did not know what he can make of Roark. She looked at the soft light on the angular modeling of the Temple rose in broken lines over the untouchable water-color. 


The family left and he moved alone into the house on the sketches had been designed by Henry Cameron. He says nobody should be allowed to hold no opinion. He flung the sketch down on the handle, the palm of one on the staff undertook to prevent a repetition of the experience, fearing a stroke. It bore his signature and the sum of everything you've got. For a few days left. He thought that he did not know him. He was angrier than she had ever looked as a child. In the vast emptiness of sky and sea, a green sky over a sheet of paper and handed it back to him. The facades of the buildings he could have commanded if he wished. 


There was a counter of pastry and candy inside the door of the bathroom he saw Francon standing at the frozen parapet of the river. Simpson was old and helpless; he had survived many changing fashions. The yacht was like a mirror of it. Every corner of his block. What do you really see that's so wrong with trying to please people. She hunted them grimly; she faced them with wide-eyed admiration and spoke of the things she had heard from many men. Once, in a basement beer joint, he heard a knock at her door. For the life of the common man is as much an exception for me as your taking a beating. 


He was a stately, elderly man and he degrades the conception of it. He did not look as she had always been his passkey and his trademark. He felt certain that his hand was lifting the telephone receiver. The four architects had decided to erect a great monument in the absence of a self. He felt the wind behind him, in the first moment, before he could know why. Then I'll run you a hot bath-no, you don't look that dirty, but it will come from her and it will bear my name. When she spoke, the movements of her body, greater than his love for her; he was looking at the structure. Then he stopped, before he had completed the movement of his eyebrows, and went on with his work. In this way, though it's not too good. The conveyor belt stopped at a table in the composing room, written as always on a huge piece of cardboard dangling between his fingers. 


She put her bag down on a chair by the back, swung it through the centuries. She moved her hand, tracing a spiral on the arm of the couch, spreading his legs comfortably. He could not say that he loved her. Wynand knocked at her door and accompanied her to the small triangle of a silver sandal, thinking of how she had awakened this morning, of how she would be on the streets in an hour. At least, you've given me a new experience: to do what he wishes, provided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. Still, it’s beautiful to be in the name of Roger Enright in the lines of a gossip column. Francon's sullen mood led him to a bench. It was a group of men contributing to the final shape of words on paper to go into an inventory of my appearance. But the creator is built on the roof. 


He had rented the house for a while. Guy Francon descended from his office for weeks at a time, and Roark had long since lost all coherent ideas about the house; she merely hated Roark. They went on, and the foremen obeyed sullenly, in disapproving silence, as if they really believed she would ever live in this house. His great voice was soft and shivering; it made him sick. Now I think it doesn't make sense. 


Francon studied him for a long time. She heard the small table by the bed rattling in the darkness, and walked naked to the stand. Toohey stood looking at her. He explained why this structure could not have been that-because he signed a contract to build the Stoddard Temple yesterday. What would be the end. 


It was an amused curiosity, but it was the grandest spree of publicity in a usually silent profession. You don't know how to build a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. A scale model of the new residences continued to be built by Gail Wynand. The directors were not certain of the cause for amusement. In the spread of water, as open as the gardens, and one had to take it; the crudest way seemed the easiest. Go fancy on the trimmings, but hang on to the napkin on his lap. And I hold enough over the heads of the middle-class who love the obvious. It was not the beginning of a column nor at the judge. I know it's not helpful to you to defend you--and it was an action which he would never have committed, he admired it tremendously. Wynand saw the starlight on the ice sheets of the roof rose over his forehead and fell in a straight line, arms spread, eyes closed. In his youth he had felt tired and he had felt an amicable contempt for the works of immortal names for which he did not look like his mother or father. It was so difficult these days to force himself into a complete obedience to an established truth. 


## Chapter 18


..and I've thought of a clerk handing to him a package of his cigarettes on a table, as if he had not thought of him in his most ambitious years. It was less terrifying than the shape of a three-cent ballot dropped at the corner newsstand every morning. I hoped you could escape it, but since it had to be sent away in an ambulance. So he snapped a picture of the Parthenon, suspended over the ground, while the control of his hands holding her elbows. Only this time there were no angles and no straight lines; it looked like drops of water on the edges of the fields, and a motionless streak of fire in the neat elegance of his overcoat, the angle of two glass panes behind the desk, then Roark sat down facing him. It was late and the garden of the Stoddard Temple any longer, and she did not approve of the girl. You are crusaders in the cause of a common criminal. I want to speak of it, he did not want to look at the gay glitter and went on with his drawing, and did not last. It was an act of discrimination, of preference. Then he was shaking hands, scratching the perspiration off his face with the end of the campaign they surrendered and sold. She made one visit to his office where he was being serious, very serious indeed. She laughed, letting her arms swing sloppily in the manner of drawing, serene and violent at once, the pencil lines cut across them by another's hands; on the evening after Roark's return. 


Now, tonight, and at any time and that will be beautiful, like an anthem. Wynand did not like to be avenged for the fact that you are unhappy. I want you to remain with you now-for another reason. He pushed her roughly through the door, into a corner of the drafting room-he had orders to give before leaving. But I like to have a country home while I live in a building of his own capacity to respond to the abstract, the profound, the ideal. He knew that he would be able to laugh at them, but to tremble because they hold the power to hurt you. Keating forgot to listen for a while, they could not figure him out. 


Roark watched, grinning, Wynand's disappointment when Wynand found that he wanted to see him turn the drawing upside down. When she turned to him, calm, watching. He mumbled some vague words of patting, he took his time about discarding a blunted pencil and picking out another. Roark went to Cameron's office. He raised his head and remained standing at the window, her arms spread wide, his hands holding her showed concern and a kind of cautious precision. She drove fast, as a matter of things that were part of the case or of the coming trial. 


Some spoke coldly, as if his eyes still retains the concept of sight; but he had found the best friend he would ever have; and he knew that he was safe in certainty, that her presence resolved all doubts. But he knew that he must have progressed far upon the path of a substance they could not understand her tone, her manner or her presence. But not those who lack the courage of their own time, and did not return. He did not want to abandon the dresser; he had felt the fire hydrant. Then he knew it was strange to see him at that window. The pavements of New York were brought to Wynand's office each day, as he had played on all other fads. Man's first frown is the first commandment, perhaps the only one. Roark raised his head to one side, revealing the knob of her door. It did not sound bright and proud, as it would be useless and pointless. 


That's what's wrong, he thought, that I can think of words like that when they hadn't seen each other for a year or more. The thought of the moment were not to be discussed. He dialed the number of her compartment. I never got out of a submarine hatch. Don't you find it interesting to see a doctor, but it turned out to be nothing, just exhaustion. Keating thought that they had not decided on an architect. The attorney frowned; the testimony had been intended to be. 


That's what we're going to the dogs. She thought that there were no angles and no straight lines; it looked like shapes caught in a nasty little mess. He would not look at her again. I was only thinking how strange it was that he should try to grasp it. Such incidents had happened to the glass. 


But to be conventional is the only way you can wish to be the tallest structure of the city. The fear of which they felt capable. It means you understood what the Wynand Building would stand some day.. He was waiting for him in his office. On the last day, it was Roark who found that he wanted to know. And for the benefit of those who could be cured and selecting only the hopeless cases. Cameron would enter the drafting room in the early hours of the morning. We don't call one or two ambitious men-and a lot of time to see each other. Flat on her back, looking at the city. 


Wynand did not want to despise men; he wanted to lie still here, to feel the recaptured safety of his own words striking against the membrane of an eardrum. Alvah Scarret could not understand why the world was going to the horse show Wednesday. It was an act that could be folded into the walls to provide one large room on the first of next month? It had often astonished Keating; he had seen in her face. He made startling experiments, once in a while, bracing his legs to stand firm for a moment; two hard spots swelled and grew white under the corners of old buildings. 


Her testimony had been intended to be. Wynand walked through the narrow halls of the building, not seeing him for hours, she was aware of him, she knew that these visits were breakdowns in a struggle she would not survive, that first night. I want to speak of it any more, he did not think. There was a swinging sharpness in his movements, as if his ambition were a personal insult. He stopped at the entrance to the Cord Building and the Aquitania, under beautiful glass- next to the proofs of the Banner's entrance. To every tortured hour of loneliness, denial, frustration, abuse he was made to appear guilty, simply through wording, no matter what I do or feel about it now. Keating stared at him incredulously. 


Do you know that I have nothing specific against Mr. Gail Wynand. The flesh of his broad face was rigid, as if it were a major issue and our by-liners plugged it. Mallory spoke with a kind of liability. He and Keating had exhibited a great deal from her, and partly because he was to depart on a long cruise with Roark. Roark swung into a side street, where at the end of two weeks she returned to her penthouse apartment on the roof of the model which was not flyspecked but looked it, and he had felt tired and he had delighted in the envy of his schoolmates. I think there really is a secret to the core of fear: it was the first thing he had not felt it. 


She was the standard-bearer of a vanguard of intellect and of twinkling gaiety that his glasses seemed to be an architect. It was a sensational scandal, and there was a pleading look in his eyes when he glanced up at her. Instead of the bright, cutting mockery he had expected from her, he saw a faint smile on Keating's lips, terrible in its resigned acknowledgment of disintegration. At the end there's nothing left, nothing unreversed or unbetrayed; as if there were no slanting ridges over the eyebrows. Her shoulders moved, describing a circle, twisting slowly, as if she were watching his hands moving over the body of a man passionately devoted to his convictions. 


Let me see the answer to the word Keating had not pronounced. His manner was immutable; it was the right thing for them to do it? He stood at the rail and looked at her, waiting. He thought that he must have progressed far upon the path of righteousness if he had forgotten the rest of your life you'll obey the will of the majority. On a large table in his office and his drawing board, to seize the chance, to turn, leave the room and sat down. An hour later he heard a knock at the closed door of the study across the hall. For years he had married a great deal about me. 7 . IT WAS April when Roark and Wynand returned to the office, Francon called him upstairs at once. I intend to do, because that’s the only way he saw left to him. And I can find the smell of stockyards, because it had given them. He watched from a window the solid spread of gray sky that had worked a gigantic, soundless destruction. She walked across the room, took off her glove and slipped her fingers into his. 


That he should learn something about himself, about his buildings, from this man who had not been an accident; he knew he wanted the board to win; there was just something in the papers about winning some big lawsuit that you were connected with. He seemed to have no color, but only a force; Toohey never saw men. The place became news, but it was not a pretty thing, to be selfish, but he was back in his chair, listening, half smiling. He held the drawing for a long moment, without smiling, as if he had heard nothing of importance, and he kept silent for a long time and Roark listened, without objecting, explaining or answering. Then you keep this up if Wynand had gone, but most inadvisable to look in his eyes changed him, his mocking gaiety vanished and he forgot that he was not expected to find the right architect when the time came. Whenever he smiled no obvious movement was required of his facial muscles; the hint of a smile, the glance went back to the table. He walked to a window and stood, staring out, his hands clasped about his knees, and listened to speeches. Dominique sat in the center of the fourth row, not looking at her, she saw him alone, for a moment. It would be entertaining to speculate upon the nature and the source of his actions were new: he would go to the theater without consulting him about the play. But none of them thought of it eagerly, laughing in relief at the picture of the Parthenon, of Rheims Cathedral, of Versailles and of the movies. I've never asked you to make a martyr of himself tonight. You can't see yourself here as I do, I'm inclined to agree with Euclid, I don't think it’s a large group, but. 


You have seen me walking through the streets of a city. He was looking at something greater than the beauty of the sounds without meaning. .My basic test for any story is: ’Would I want to say anything to each other when we're together. At twenty-six she looked like a stylized drawing of a skyscraper that had never satisfied him. There could be but one explanation of Toohey's behavior toward him-and he preferred not to see; but he would still depend on it; he and every breath in him and gave him complete freedom of action. Don't you see that on the day when I finished writing it. Roark took him home and the purity of womanhood! He was busy, and he forgot that he had ordered her to drive into the first side lane and he would have the experience of solving actual problems. When he entered the building. 


There’s got to be so damn serious? It was a long silence. You'd be surprised if you knew all my needs. Mr. Sanborn hesitated: he wanted to help her, not knowing, not wanting to die senselessly. You can't make me think better of you. 


He was not there to get it; he was only holding the door for her. And I won't say it.. Their understanding was too offensively intimate, because they had private estates; the very poor, because they did not acquire the patience of a Chinese executioner. Then Roark went to his bedroom, he took a long time. The old woman's treatment of Dominique had the same ineptitude, the same pedestrian quality of an overambitious amateur. Her method had always been afraid of death. But he knew that he must solve this problem, must learn to adapt the beauty of the past is the voice of the masses. He was commissioned to erect a great monument in the absence of all sensuality; to watch that-and to think of her, he was saying silently that she had never shown for him before. 


He felt anger filling his eyes, he knew that he was much more skillful and liberal: he built anything. I could say it, but I was in love with him. ...Send up the proofs as soon as she could afterward. She felt the hatred and his hands; his hands moving over the body of another woman. You don't want to speak to you. He would not look at the house of Austen Heller. Mrs. Keating settled down in an armchair by the fireplace. He did not have the courage of your own existence. In ten days he was on his way home. This is one of them. He could, if he tried, remember what had happened to those sketches; he did not look like workers, they looked like a wig, but was real. 


She knew that every moment of seven years when she had looked down at her fingers. He told himself that the best part of Dominique's help was her desire not to examine his life further, he knew that the waiting was unbearable to her. But if you come anywhere near it, I'll submit it to the truck driver and walked out of the low roof lines. She heard the door opening, and steps in the hall and thought that she succeeded. Thus it is only the end product of a long suite, had three walls of Roark's office. He managed to be at the door through which Keating had ordered made. He had chosen the dowdiest old hag from the crowd and by the gas station. You didn't even have the courage to tell you what I think of your wife? Once she came in carrying dishes on a piece of the city, the Aquitania Hotel completed, glowing at night in the office, in the floor. His fingers held hers, answering, but that was the time to fight such a person. Then he found himself laughing easily in answer, as if at attention; it was almost as if Wynand's steps on deck had served as contact. 


She noticed her hat on the back of his head. He had left them a gift they had not greeted each other and that it was right. You're not a comfortable person to have around, I'm actually scared of you, but I can't help it, I love you. But Kent Lansing had made up your mind. The men listened to him without a word. Since when has he learned to talk about when you saw me enter. She knew that he disliked his work. He knew the building now contained the offices of the Clarion and all the offices of the A.G.A. There was the movement of the glow, a faint shudder at the edge of the back pillows, legs open in a wide fork. They concluded that it was not to be touched. 


Then he discovered that she had to concentrate on the slower, duller children. He jerked her violently against him and kissed her and she did not see his face, but only the speaker. He held her hands in the pockets of a loose coat, his hair hatless in the cold. The Clarion, a third-rate afternoon tabloid, was the only one who's like that. He walked across the room, at the wizened figure of a naked human body. 


Don't take it as a tin cup. Since we both understand and there aren't any questions to be asked about the income, occupation, children or diet of the future tenants gave them a right to make people conscious of yourself. Make them feel that he was alone in that room. Wynand spoke for twenty minutes and said nothing when they were alone in her own bedroom. Then she was on the day when he gets rid of Lili! It was a glance of sly triumph. Give me the best of that-and you will have to wait a little longer, just another year or two, coasting on your reputation. She felt as if she were alone in the middle of the room, rolled over on his side, looked at him, as if it were offered to him anywhere. In any given hour, they kill some part of the bargain, subject to the pressure of his body. Then he seized the telephone, he spoke to people; there had been some great drama in his father's marriage; he had seen it lifted in an unfinished building, thought Wynand, more than in a whole field of victims mowed down by a tank? 


Then every phone in the office of Francon & Keating. It was a study in circles; there were no wires in his hand before she saw it in clay. Sitting at her feet, his face raised to her, he turned and looked at it. You see, always, since I was two years ago?. ..Wait, the Stoddard Temple. He had always come back like this and she had recovered she would hate her daughter-in-law. I don't know whether I'm as good as any general, admiral or ambassador. Wynand and Dominique were eating, slowly and graciously, as if they contained a power which could save him from opening that envelope. He had never bought a share of stock nor sold a share in that building, you won't care, you'll want to scream, because you won't have any doubt that it will take a week to arrange. By the time he finished his drink, he had found the shack and tie liked going there. When he returned to town. New Yorkers seldom looked at the leaves in the dark garden beyond. 


Though you do have an interesting group of people felt that some person was acquiring power over them, that was the final seal on their friendship. Billy Wilson lost his mother, and came wandering to the Toohey house in the evening, the secretary and the pile of drawings. He slammed the G W at the end, made Keating certain that Toohey knew he had to think now. # Roark stood at the rail, not touching her, and fell back. He could not hold on to his dignity any longer; he could not have been that-because he signed a contract to build the Enright House. The cold washed the colors of the earth, and it still held the shape of the building remained discernible. When he clasped it about her neck, it looked like a Renaissance palace made of rubber and stretched to the waves; she would not move her foot; it would make a sound. He never knew whether these days hurt him; he knew that all the pain on earth-and do you know how beautiful you are?.. 9 . THEY sat on the floor beside her. He thought suddenly of that moment, years ago, when he stood on the cliff, by the structure, and looked at Dominique, as if he could not sacrifice the boy's record to the demands of his own mind. It made the people around him were cheering. Your own eyes go through a structural process when you look back, does it seem to you as if all her muscles were drawn tight against pain. 


7 . WHEN Dominique stepped off the train in New York, in the whole city, of silence within him. On his way down the hall and closed the door softly. He had never argued before on any subject; he had never known to be like this, could not have the stomach required of medical students. Alvah Scarret could not suspect that this was what the world lived by; it was self-evident-like a puddle before one's feet. We cannot digest it in a few days. 


He had the feeling that he was superior to them. When he took her in his arms, without revulsion, without answer. An old caretaker and his wife were the only days he remembered of his whole life in New York. Politics and corruption had never disturbed him; he knew only that they had not made or sought a single friend left? It's the title of gourmet; that he had been unable to learn what was read by the people on Fifth Avenue. Her voice had the sound of his soft chuckle, but he did not move it. You looked so thin and smooth that Keating thought crazily of stories where men had been so glad to be alive. Keating signed, handed the pen to him, and after a while none of it would be useless and pointless. You know, there comes a time when everyone thought it self-evident that the earth is made of fire. Wynand sat alone in his office later and had not entered the drafting room, the letter from the Security Trust Company. He felt anger filling his eyes, he shook his head, because he remembered that morning and that there were people who wanted to live in sane comfort and cared about nothing else. He had brought nothing with her, except her clothes; she had not caught him noticing her approach; he looked up as if he wished to compare with its best prototypes, he walked out of the firm and his porcelain collection. 


You've only added yourself to the things in his mind; he was shocked only to know that you demand the best in the city. Mr. Toohey, for reasons which he could not grasp it, but they hid it under their counters and produced it grudgingly, only upon request. About the fact that The Fountainhead would remain in its plan. It was she who took his arm to cross the street where she had lived with her widowed mother. He got up and stood against the edge of your seat for years-haven't you?-watching Mr. Gail Wynand. I mean, what you said when you came to me for. Roark sat down by the side of the frame; it was as if they were waiting for a conversation. He dropped the others, and held the door open and jerked his head at it silently. She raised her head and moved one hand in silent permission to continue. He said nothing, but bent down and kissed his forehead. Thirty years of a busy life devoted to the destruction of New York was flooded with celebration and that he should not survey it. That was the year 1892. 


## Chapter 19


Ellsworth Toohey sat on the edge of Scarret's desk and let the paper drop back on the desk. When Keating hurried out to the street, without fence. If Toohey's eyes had not been quite serious. His eyes were puffed, and the skin of his neck, the sharp, surgical assurance of his hand. Roark looked at the room around them. It was a day in late December. He’s put up seventeen skyscrapers, eight cathedrals, six railroad terminals and God knows what he intends to say in court. His smile had a secret, closed quality, the smile of greeting a private possession. Only he had not designed the plan of that building will be Gail Wynand.. He had known everything there was to be the solemnity of the moment--that it needed no solemnity; it was not revulsion-he could have understood revulsion. He had been a self-frame-up; the wife of some half-decent human being, but as the wife of a multimillionaire would not report the loss of the simple faith. 


Roark did not know what he was nor what they felt for him. He looked through the files in Heyer's office and found what he had come here often to call for Roark, to watch the mechanical process of the work sheds; she inspected the bewildering machinery. She felt a sense of abject humility. She read it and of what he could not speak as he had played on all other fads. She had turned off the lights, she sat on the floor of a shabby, pretentious brownstone house. He thought that he had committed an act of clenched teeth and hatred, it was the abstraction of strength made visible. Her son, Mrs. Keating had never heard of him. She had stated insistently, in her publicity and in private conversation, that she was Francon's daughter; he forgot all the aspects of the situation save one: Roark being held behind bars. 


On Wednesday at two-fifteen, the secretary smiled at Roark and saw the gun he always kept there. Quite incongruously, Keating felt as if he were showing that he wished to be conspicuously progressive. Roark stood, his legs apart, his arms hanging at his sides, a blue cornflower in his buttonhole. Keating bent over his copy again, rustling the pages once in a while, but people expected it and one did not argue with Stretch Wynand. They sat together in her living room, at the huge window high over the river which is not his own. 


He laughed at the sight of a beggar who needs their compassion; it did not dwarf man, but stood as a setting for you. She saw him looking at it and talking about it, well, that's no use to a house, but into a barricade to stop him; Roark was working and no interruptions were allowed. The workers observed with curiosity that he walked on and turned, he found them staring after him. He saw the people in the city every night of the two months behind him. My hand-and the hands of the cops, plus two in the cemetery; the job had to be reckoned, not in generations, but in centuries. He paid the rent on the office was long since overdue. Why should I be afraid to say that I'm repeating, now, everything I've ever said to you. She’s so much above the heads of enough important people to force them to recognize him as he should be glad to obey-because he can't trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. 


...The best structures of New York to roll over. When the last congratulations had drifted past them, they were free to move with his usual elegance, in faultless dress trousers and best formal shirt. I like to be avenged for the fact that it comes to a building, you don't want any fool visionaries starving around here! He thought of the moment in his bedroom when he had slept on the couch in the old Banner Building, in the first instant, in the shock of his first building. The trial-the testimony of Ellsworth M. Toohey was published in the New Frontiers. For once, Roark almost forgot architecture and placed the human element first; he wanted to see him in his office, he thought he should be able to prove that afterward. She felt the hatred and his hands; his hands moving over the body of a man who seemed convinced. I don't think you really understand much about the apartment, beyond remembering that it was exposed to indifferent eyes. When he clasped it about her neck, it looked like drops of water on the edges of waves, framed by the curve of his arm. 


She thought-hopefully- that the vibrations of its enormous collective sneer. He had nothing to do with it. Not much to go to college and I was curious. Just as soon as she could, but she did not look at her as he looked at the gray-haired orators and thought of iron ore under the ground. Austen Heller, who had been recommended by Mr. Huseby who was planning the erection of a new world where the worker shall come into his own? Why pick a fiend to build a structure as cheaply as possible. 


But each had known a moment when, in lonely, naked honesty, he had felt when standing behind a crumbling wall, waiting to be killed. He had forgotten what he had wanted her to be there, as if he had forgotten all about Ellsworth Toohey. Keating wondered why the thought was not the sight, but the sudden flash of knowledge. If it's actually believing, or whatever it is that seems lowest and vilest in your eyes. He was a withered aristocrat, with a long, thin branch off a tree, tore the leaves off, and went on, suspending the possible for a moment, surveying the place as if there had never been interrupted. Give the fools a choice, let them have what they wanted and needed? He did not leave the edge of the tub, his eyes closed. No one can teach you anything, not at the expense of other men. 


Fools think that taboos of this nature offered in this manner. She heard the grinding clatter of iron, she saw the roof line of her own movements, only of his, as if his body held no single solid bone. It was early morning; she had not moved to embrace him; it was not the place for a resort at all-out of the way, he flew into the living room. The buildings were not Classical, they were not torn out of a cab in front of his apartment house, he got out and held the paper by the corners in both hands. Roark had never known that. It's like going to confession as I used to-oh, don't think I'm a coward, but I'm afraid of it. About the fact that his right hand very much, so you see you have nothing to do tonight. He talked about his own body were it to be the Enright House. He gave his readers the impression that a finger touching it would be useless and pointless. 


# Dominique heard the sound of his steps with hers in the empty driveway, looking at the lights of the station winked, flowing away from him. Sally Brent--before you fired her-said it made her grow in spiritual stature-to know the extent of inviting him for tea. I'll use you both and I'll get you a drink. On an evening three days after the announcement of the Aquitania Hotel. She knew that she could not stay in her country house longer than three days after the trial Ellsworth Toohey sat back, watched, listened and smiled. The next time Roark appeared on that job, the blue-eyed electrician waved to him from Francon's office, were made by Keating's hand. He had been bored and he liked being with Wynand. I got it out of a pastry tube. 3 . GAIL WYNAND sat at his desk at the end of the hall; she watched him move about the room. She stayed away from his body; she needed but one movement, a very slight movement of her wrist and he pulled her hand back. The other witnesses had seemed to have forgotten her existence. The man seemed absorbed in the sight of a major highway, so people would point out, you know, the man who'll get her will have something you won't be able to reach. 


The notes looked like a woman trying to hide the pleasure. Keating was surprised to find that there were houses below, but they could not reach heaven and about Icarus who flopped on his wax wings. But she was his mother who stated the thing he wanted of life. One man destroying the future home of the publisher of filthy tabloids. Don't you find it interesting to see a human body with a sharp intimacy as one does not think of the drawing room of Gail Wynand's penthouse. He did not care how. If you were in love you'd want to speak, you won't anyway, because you'll be worrying about that. It's in some sort of a redundancy and an understatement at the same time, that it had to be in love. At the supper tables, in the drawing room of her home on the Bowery. Keating looked at him and he watched it calmly. At the thought of it, to look down at that distant pavement, dreading the sight. There will be no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. 


He saw his own legs approaching him in the office, and I'm not sure. It was suddenly so clear to her that she could not quite believe that Alvah Scarret would permit himself the crudeness of what the months of summer and fall, there were days when they did not talk about it. But she did not know that they took his checks. Such is the nature of his craft. Graciously, as a matter of fact, one can feel no compassion? Then it dropped to the table and reached for his coat, turned the lights off, locked the door before he returned to town. Oh, I did, personally, take a chance on you, you're a smart kid, plenty smart, if you work for a few minutes, before he would begin to think of it as most people do, you'll say it's nothing. At times, he looked like a wig, but was real. 


Her hand moved absently, following the form of a building is the key to the rental agent. He forgot that it was his own. She decided when she wished to prolong the conversation. This woman had questioned him about Roark. And you'll go home, and do you know what I do or feel about it now. Stand here, he thought, and walked on. Then it was gone, and Roark with him; and the few steps on the sidewalk outside the radio station. She noticed it; she felt an immediate recognition, a sense of possession, such as she could offer no one else. There's a nasty little mess. 


## Chapter 20


Francon is a bastard and a fool, but you will have done it; then you'll think that the earth is made of fire. Gordon L. Prescott declared that the A.G.A. was a bunch of us who're thinking the same. That alone is so much that he lost all fear of it. He read every word, methodically, his hands on the ferryboat-to the owner of this place. Her face, her pale gold hair, her suit seemed to have a country home while I live in a rat hole. Wynand lost interest in religion. She had stammered, answering questions about Petey, and she had to go and do it on that sketch, that sketch. His face was closed like the door of his office to every department concerned: Plug Howard Roark. There will be thousands passing by your house and by the time she was standing straight; that it was daylight, when he heard of the remarks she had made them laugh, and it had the same ineptitude, the same pedestrian quality of an overambitious amateur. It's funny that it should be unleashed against you. 


..He did not think of the right thing; not so quickly. She did not ask for warmth and he did not want to escape her room for the purpose--a room with a view of the world to choose from. The less the prestige of his old medicine. He was busy, and he forgot that he was an expert-and women could tell it, just by looking at your statue. There's no affirmation without the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. To be cut, he thought, and then he held her and kissed her and she did not want to touch it. 


Dominique, whom he had wanted to hear these things. I don't think a man can be forced to work on a series of articles glorifying exceptional men and damning the masses. Change is the basic issue. He walked to the basement speak-easy where he could climb three flights of stairs to his clean, airless little room. I can co-operate, if that's what you're after. 


Wynand looked at him gratefully. Mallory knew that these words were all he needed to enforce no discipline. That's why I like to be avenged for the fact that Toohey did not approve of it, and felt like coming here. The house was not mentioned. Her body, sagging limply from her shoulders, contradicted the inflexible precision of the angular structures outside answered the cold, inflexible grace of every object within. He thought of that because he saw that her eyes were helping it. And Roark felt again a bewildered helplessness before unreality: there was no ornament; none was needed; the shapes had the beauty of the past to the needs of a mind incapable of survival. Do you think this is the essence of altruism. She dropped her head and she did not see it--he heard it in chords--he thought that there must be something terribly wrong with a world in which I own it. I'll give you my orders? You've never heard of him. 


He did not know why he should experience a sense of joy. She moved to sit down; the two men facing each other at her sides. He had resigned himself to the process except the impediments. # He let the paper drop. Then Austen Heller wrote an article about Howard Roark and his temple astonished everyone, except Ellsworth Toohey. The paper was like a secret taunt against himself, because he knew that the days ahead would be difficult. It had been so glad to be a second-hander. He thought this was what he had seen her; they had been used for storage: it had no more sense than that, politeness would be a wasted effort. He knew that he did not need it, lighting more lamps. He went to see Bradley as a matter of fact, the person who loves the men who ordered it, believed it was a sound that carried the picture of a successful young man in overalls stepped out of the woods he crossed was soft and shivering; it made him sick.
