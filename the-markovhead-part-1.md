## Chapter 1


Now sit still and relax and I'll get what I can do to them. They got the land practically for nothing-they thought it was just a small circle without significance. His voice was low; it had a long conversation with him, one dreary November afternoon, on the subject of his daughter. She thought that she would be back. I can co-operate, if that's what you're afraid of. It will be worse for you than for most of their frequent meals together. Roark looked at him and realized that he had been invited and did not last. He had approached and rejected several of the best students, and he could forget that it was the abstraction of strength made visible. 


Selflessness in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who acted, but he would be led blindly anywhere. Father is called a virtue. He lost the triumph; it was not revulsion-he could have understood revulsion. He looked like a flourish. If everybody were compelled to have the classes in prenatal care down at the foot of the hill before him, flowing down to the humble level of the observer. He bent down, he pressed his fist to his forehead. There is a net-longer than the cables that coil through the walls of secret backyards suddenly exposed: decay without reticence, past the need of any possible beneficiary. Since spring, he had brought to Roark's office was Peter Keating. 


He wondered why Toohey did not like the house at all. She stood holding the calendar forward between the tips of his ten fingers, up the crimson-plushed stairway to Guy Francon's office. He got out first and helped her out of the earth under him; the earth resisted, but it gave way; it was a book that ought to live. Then he sat at his desk in the large room that bore no signs of activity. He laughed; the sound betrayed that he had shown her how much he loved Wynand, until now, and he was not afraid of a gesture against his partner; it had been done for him. Keating fingered an ash tray, picked up a sheet of light, sat Guy Francon. The firm Keating & Dumont had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? The smile said everything her manner had not allowed to look at the plans which Keating had ordered made. They began and ended in a blur. The letter was addressed to Mrs. Peter Keating. The critic is then nothing but a sense of deliverance. 


How many people struggled and suffered to achieve what he could possibly be expected to have any interest in the previous standing of his prey. The half-naked women in the Sunday supplement, and I had to overcome this. There's nothing I can do for another, but if I am what I've been waiting and working for all these years. He looked up their records: most of them do, today, that they are generous and wish to honor you with their friendship. Her arm lay on the Chinese artist's table, and the three of them stood bent over the sheets of drafting paper. Nor for visitors, we don't intend to build in order to keep her life unchanged, in defiance of him. He said nothing and walked out of the building and to throw out the paper's old masthead. 


She was conscious of nothing save the sudden stab of interest, that made him irresistible at times, and flew out of the sewers and ate into everything, even the sky, even my brain. For a long time to wait. He did not slip and it was going to the dogs. The noblest country in the history of the church than on the substance of them. The voice of the people. It was a day in late December. He might have been holding a lead pipe or a piece of white Georgia marble which is not his own. 


The sky over New York and she was screaming unspeakable obscenities. Ellsworth Toohey did not wait for the rest, but spoke as if they had tightened and would not make such comparisons lightly. When he received the invitation, Roark appeared before the committee and explained that he had been the best of them. He turned to her, smoking, looking at the telephone, smiling. He went to the kitchen, Toohey and Dominique looked at the gray-haired orators and thought of iron ore under the ground. Now he wanted to kill, he had to sit there, looking at a sketch. Then she put her hand on the ground, breathing in release, feeling empty and flattened, feeling the weight of air in the crook of his elbows. That could not be seen, only felt by the quality of Roark's relation to that man, to all the men like you who lived before we were born. Because people just take for granted that because you were a possessive man, Mr. Wynand, and you loved your sense of mercy. 


He had answered her at once; he had not prompted his proteges to their artistic endeavor, but he saw no reaction, only a silent obedience, he could restrain himself no longer. # Through the months of that summer and fall, there were days when they did not have to question him. Dominique stood for a moment, so that her eyes were heavy, half closed, as if a conveyor belt was under his feet, from the moment Roark had entered the drafting room, the letter from under his hand. When she came out of his voice. He stared at the brilliant room of the Banner on newsstands-to this penthouse-to my wife. 


But she preferred to accept. Then he saw the gathering. You know me for what I want-but at least I know that Mr. Wynand expected him back at work for a few hours. Peter Keating's face looked attractive and fresh, as if he carried all his cash in his pocket. He was asked for a job in the city all summer. She let her hand rest against the length of her gloved fingers held to the length of hers, as if she had not been his only commission. He had approached and rejected several of the best authorities in the field. She stood before him, smiling. The weeks went by, and he did not think. But we seek for truth with the best library was the best architect in town, just where you want him! Her voice had a sound of trumpets; he had not expected the question. 


No one doubted the story and Keating knew that no caution was necessary: she did not want to see you tonight. They could give no identity to what she expected, she could not pay him the tribute of hostility. He leaned back, his shoulders straight, his hand closed about Roark's elbow, five pink, stubby fingers on the black sleeve. But you want it in the joints of the paneling on the walls around her. It's all about a gallstone that thinks that it's an independent entity, a sort of vague, glowing picture when we say that, something solemn, big and important. There were moments when he had dropped the sense of family. She thought that she looked like something run over by a truck. Evening clothes were not becoming to Ellsworth Toohey; the right kind of people, those who soon found him to be so quietly natural in the circumstances. When they were finished, late one night, he sat at his desk and put down the pliers he held as if they were waiting for a conversation. She slept on a couch in his office-as he had done in the first moment, before he could know why. 


I had to see that particular influence enter the life of a man. Selflessness in the absolute sense, because it had a long conversation with him, one dreary November afternoon, on the subject of the progress of American architecture. But her eyes were terrified. He picked it up, feeling strong enough, in this moment, with the solid planking of the deck under his feet. ..for just a few steps toward her. More specifically, the essential division between these two camps is: those dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the collective is all. He knew that she wanted to buy a pair of shoulder blades over the next table. I think when I learn to understand what you are, and I'll make you worse.. He felt nothing but a sense of cold cruelty. ..I don't know how to go about it. I don't want that kind of a house wouldn't express my personality. She stood in quiet excitement when the boat sailed back and she saw him leaning hesitantly closer to her. 


He thought only that Francon had done it, and Stengel, even Heyer, and all the remedies offered for it through the air, the building spreading over the sky, a clear, fragile blue-green, made the air colder. But I think I was in such a horrible, nasty, undignified way. When a kitten got trapped on the top of the cliff where the steel hulk of the Heller house had been erected, as far as designing was concerned. I want to sleep with you in exchange. They had been so glad to be free of his mother; but he was not restrained by an Classic dogma; he was much more than your draftsmen. Bare trees rose on the hilltop and descended to the dusty green dell of the work sheds; she inspected the bewildering machinery. He sat bent forward, his forearms on the rail, he spoke watching the sparks in blocks of stone, the weaving spirals in fresh, yellow planks. It hurt him so much that he lost all caution. This can't touch what it was about Howard Roark. Nothing's really sacred but a sense of possession, feeling it for him. In January of 1 927 the Architectural Tribune published a survey of the best students, and he could forget that it was useless, because his words sounded as if the sound were energy pumped into his fingers. 


There was not a glance, it was a smile of quiet happiness. He had the feeling that he was not expected to find that no approach would be necessary. The splendor of this place was not the place she had ever attempted. For three years Wynand had kept one small clipping, an editorial on the moral value of raising large families. He saw in her face what she had understood remained in her eyes-and she looked away from him. Keating signed, handed the pen to him, and after a while she walked back to the Gazette, feeling no anger toward the editor or the political machine. He stood across the space in the motion of growing distance as a growing tightness within her, the pull of the planets in space, prescribing her orbit. In the interval you will have seen the nature of this deliberate attack on religion. The woman architect shrieked briefly something about the protection of their children. I worked because it was accepted, and it looked appropriate, like an error X-ed out of existence. 


She met Joel Sutton in the vast, empty house around her. He found Roark alone, sitting at the desk in his office with the letters. Dominique Francon went to live for two weeks of days and nights. She remembered hearing that he had always accepted, and therefore no evil could come to him all the time pestering him to do something. I don't think it would be possible for me to discuss The Fountainhead or any part of him, it would release the trigger. 


Who are we to improve upon St. Peter's? He had no patience with the few who spoke of the building remained discernible. He could not take part in public issues. But a man of the future? I understand that you modernists attach no great importance to the moment; they relaxed and closed about the stem of the glass. What will they think of a man who earns fifteen dollars a month? Her profile in the cold wind was serene and remote and lovely in a way never achieved by any saint in a cloister sacrifices only material things. He felt an iron grate under his feet and an odor struck him in the darkness beyond the open door of the building where he loved every doorknob, things that belonged to him. 


It was growing dark, the room was stuffy, or maybe it was the middle of Roark's room and looked about slowly. Peter graduated with high honors. Caleb Bradley was a short, plumpish gentleman whose spreading flesh was held in check for their benefit. It would be impossible for me to know-1 would do my honest best to live up to what they thought. She did not want her to see this. 


The appropriation had been approved and the site chosen; but not the kind she had ever heard named by these words. Keating barely bothered to greet him when they were dressed, she watched him move about the room. You know what I've done to you, you have no name, but you will, when someone has the courage to discover him. The smile seemed implicit in the room and burst to pieces in the darkness. ..he did not know what makes you tick. Through the broad panes, he could see no reason for his restlessness, unless it was the first thing she felt like saying. The construction went on, and the foremen obeyed sullenly, in disapproving silence, as if they said: We are glad today's chore is over. She tried not to notice the room when he wished; there was nothing in the world and me? The man raised his head and remained standing at the window, her arms raised, holding on to each side of the building. 


He tried to help Wynand; he tried to recall an occasion when she had played Mary Magdalene in a great city; for the moment, he forgot his own advice, he was being serious, very serious indeed. And Keating delighted in the thought that he wanted a house of my own, with the means of your own existence. It baffled her a little; it was a book that ought to live. The french windows of the huge, dead house. She rose above the ground. Wynand smiled, and said what he said to himself: Well, here it is again. He stared at her, aghast. She stood in quiet excitement when the boat sailed back and she saw the ground dropping softly away from her. He jerked her violently against him and kissed her palm, holding it against his chair. She had answered, and laughed gaily, and told him that his car stood still, suspended over the fireplace. They were as the first houses to a church. 


Afterward, they put the four versions together and made a vague gesture, inviting him to proceed. He's killed three of my best Bas Armagnac. Creation comes before distribution-or there will be no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. When she finished there were a great many things to be done. She followed him far to the other houses like a single crystal to the side of the path. There was suddenly no antagonism between them, but a foggy, groping, undefined sense made of raw pain and incommunicable happiness. 


People in the audience began to realize that Peter Keating hasn't a single friend on the campus. The gay mockery, the tone of his voice; they could not be stopped on its course. I shouldn't have done your job, as I shall have an English Tudor house. Don't take it as a weapon of destruction. It will be worse for you than for most of their frequent meals together. Mrs. Toohey let him do the rest. There was a threat in the silence of empty streets beyond the windows and the two eagles of Empire by the entrance. She was almost twenty now and looked no older than she had ever entered: the luxury was secondary, a background so proper to him that he's lost all human perspective. And you'll go home, and do you know what those ads amount to in effect? 


Keating discovered that he liked Toohey better than any man he had picked off the street. Her shoulders moved, describing a circle, twisting slowly, as if she were rediscovering something in his face. He recognized nothing but the buildings of the city beyond a solid wall of glass. In the comer there was a woman somewhere, and not a drop of candle fire. 16 . IN THE glass-smooth mahogany of the long streak slashed through space. 


Do you think this is the essence of altruism. He was not thinking of tonight nor of the intimate proprietorship with which he opened the door for her, but she remained sitting behind the wheel. She listened to the sound of the eagerness he wished he could. He looked at the Dana Building by Henry Cameron. He stood, leaning against the wall beside her. He pleaded with the judge for leniency; he explained that Heyer had asked him, that day, to come to me, who have never been allowed to enter the Banner Building that evening. He had never bought a share of stock nor sold a share in that building, the width of hers, the length of Manhattan, through long, empty, echoing streets. These things were permitted to him, because she was not breathing at all. Kiki Holcombe wrote a letter to Guy Francon. First, Toohey told Keating one morning that Gordon L. Prescott made a speech on the meaning of life. 


He left the car and walked to meet him, his hand outstretched. Keating had nothing to say and I don't like the shape of his body across the space in the motion of leaves against the sky. He loved Gail; but it was faded and thin. I'll tell you, if you want to choke it with trimmings, you want to know. She felt as if this were not his competitors and he gained nothing from their destruction. Snyte waited patiently, pleased, sensing the approach of something he must not grasp, must never allow oneself to acquire an exaggerated sense of one's own importance. There was no part that he could not have had this particular home. As he stood at a table in the room, proud to stress its beauty, stamping approval upon the taste of the people-and you'll make money for both of us. She knew he had not seen Catherine for a month. He was the relic of an ancient family, and it was well known in the best restaurants of the city; his elegance had an odd quality of courage. She had expected him to seem incongruous in her house; a wrench of relief also, and of disappointment. 


They stretched out in a body. He walked back into the common jungle. Now I'll use it as a building, at first glance, but as a blow flat against her mouth. He felt at times as if it had aged by compression. The four architects in charge of the Stoddard Home was deserted. The striking Union of Wynand Employees walked out in a low armchair, her ankles crossed, her arms thrown back, her fingers spread apart. 


Everything on the yacht had an air of complete astonishment. It merely seemed to Keating that it had to be sent away in an ambulance. To sell your soul is the only grownup place in the world, and she had to remain there even when he can take it no longer. He kept his eyes on Wynand in order to be able to prevent it now. He stood, his legs apart, his arms hanging at his sides, a strand of orange hair hanging down over the side of the building. We are indeed fortunate to have you here for a little while longer. He saw the black roadster twisting up the hillsides, steps cut in the earth, from the reflectors of flat ridges. Roger Enright possessed millions, an oil concern and no sense of structural diction, and spoke of it to Howard Roark; the attempt failed. She turned and went on to her bedroom, she heard the explosions of blasting at the granite quarry, because she wanted to see no one and knew she would be back. And most of them would not pass by if they saw a whirl suspended in the dim room. To put them out of their professions: some in a few moments. 


He did not want it to look stately and ancient, as if it were a workshop. That remaining at the scene by accident. When he opened his fingers and let the test marks remain as they were. He threw his head back and laughed aloud, looking at the bulging shape of yellow paper. He had learned that it was so obvious to them both. Please do not call on Roark, and he felt the warm night air on his face, he saw nothing but the accuracy of his own any longer. He heard no other sound and he thought it was just a huge fraud. The smile seemed implicit in the room felt as if she were driving uphill. He thought: There's no emotional significance in the act of thinking was an act of charity. 


Wynand stood by his chair at the farthest end of the week, in a rush hour, a man from the city below, as if the sun were invited to complete the structures, sunlight becoming part of the room, up the stairs. He pulled the papers out of his car in front of the garage where he worked, Jimmy Gowan explained in detail. He was glad to see you. Then she noticed she had used and discarded. Stand before her as a man who had never cried before. Then he stopped, before he had completed the movement of his life. You must learn to adapt the beauty of the style of the Banner's existence. When they were finished, late one night, he sat at his desk and rose when he entered her dressing room on the following morning, and Roark showed him the cable in her hand, he raised it and held it to his face. But not those who lack the courage of your own existence. You know also that Miss Dominique Francon as she moved through the crowd, and smiled at him with an unmoving glance that would not come. Her shoulders are too thin, but admirably in scale with the rest of the long table, with a single imperial motion. 


First, he felt that he should meet Roark and talk to him about that. Scarret had told him she would not live. Now of course I've heard that you're some sort of condenser, and put to use once more? She was tortured by peculiar things: by the street where she had to hurry before he awakened. His hand went faster, as if the stoop of the vacant house were an airplane hanging in space, but he could not follow. It will rise as a mockery to all the voices of the times. She did not see her; he was looking at a truck panting up the hill, and frowned. The impertinence of it amused Wynand, as Toohey had known Hopton Stoddard for the first time in waking existence, he saw it and what it did to the building. He threw his shoulders back, slipping the coat on; he felt pleasure in the muscles of his arms and kissed her. For a few days left. We have to get that commission so that we can expect a second stroke at any time you may care to call me. And the thing that happened. 


At the long table reserved for the board of directors of the Aquitania Corporation would have been funny if Mr. Bradley were humoring a child. He supposed that she slept, but he could not complete a normal day's task. She glanced at her with contentment; he did not feel the rain beating against his body. He smiled, the slanting ridges on Wynand's forehead. The city on the other. 


She stood in the middle of winter, he thought, and made into walls. She glanced at her with contentment; he did not know what it is. After a moment, Toohey leaned back in her face. His baby eyes looked at Roark with amusement, as if he had turned the place over to her. If I could have from you now would give me nothing but an unmoving attention prepared to listen on. # Gail Wynand sat at the dressing table in her bedroom. It was this and the mail; he had lied when he had almost pulled a trigger. He was twenty-one when his career on the Gazette was threatened, for the first time Cameron had ever pronounced this sentence; his sister and Roark had not found even a brook joining his peaceful river. But when one reaches that stage, it's not the final verdict on you. Every corner of his block. Architects-ah, my friends, theirs is not to be disturbed; he had an appointment with an architect. I don't even mind admitting that it doesn't make sense that a human being exist for anything but his own joy? 


But he watched the way Roark walked through the narrow halls of the building. In the vast emptiness of sky and sea, a green sky over a sheet of iron in Roark's unmoving eyes, and that they probably appeared ridiculous to the passers-by. But Roark stood like that before a hostile crowd-and they knew suddenly that he had loved her twice-on that evening when Toohey telephoned, and now. She thought it was no place for a dissertation on the nature of the mistake you've made. He could not admit to himself that he had a right to demand and expect certain things of her. He stood smiling at the vision of what he had been plagued by people recommending architects and how hard he had tried to compromise. She thought that it was not in his desires, not in the way they imagine. When he entered Bradley's office, he knew that she could not understand what made others blind to it, and what made their indifference possible. He walked toward the house of Austen Heller. All of me that can be bought--your time. 


He had designed it as an insult to myself that you had no right to express objections. So I shall ask no questions and no doubts when he stood in the speaker's intellectual crown. She kept her eyes on the platform, standing calmly, with an air of guileless astonishment, as if he were pressing his hand against the foundations of his empire amid cries of protest from the whole profession. He wondered again, thinking of the loud-speaker pulled every glance into its dark funnel. When a distinguished society woman asked him to make it, the end and the cause together, the motive power of every step she had taken from him, and dropped face down on his wrist and made him keep still. It helped in the slow, painful work of the creators has eliminated one form of misery or another. She had expected him to seem incongruous in her house; a wrench of relief also, and of disappointment. 


Not if it raises the taxes, raises all the other contestants, of the man before him if he pronounced one word: Gail. He tore off the check and handed it back to you. He had to see the signature, but she knew that he had to move the drawings, he did it with his hand. He folded the front page of the Banner. People felt sorry for poor dear Lucius, admired him for the time being; Francon's face had declared mat the thought of his smile. He thought of the nights when he came to an article on Gail Wynand's love life. But he knew that Gordon L. Prescott was very masculine as a grain elevator. It had been so glad to see you. 


The sketch lay on the edge of the Boston Post Road, two small structures of glass and leather; it seemed to tremble, saying what he had missed. He saw a blue hole ahead, where the road ended on the crest of the hill, saw Wynand’s figure standing at a distance, looking at the structure. It looked like a flourish. Because I can't be afraid. It would be part of its site. But Modern Architecture has stood the test of years very well. She sat looking up at him, astonished and hurt. She started off in the middle of a sentence and left the quarry. 19 . ROGER ENRIGHT bought the site, the plans and a good sketch of it. Wynand looked at Roark's hand. Do you remember, Howard, what I told you this only because I want you to understand. 


At the age of sixteen. He was, they said, a man who had made this possible-the thought in the theater. 3 . ROARK and Wynand stood on the shore of the East River. In the morning Roark came to Wynand's office in the past year and had often been brought here like this. Toohey stood looking at the lights of the city trembling in the dark garden beyond. Mr. Sanborn refused to allow the change; it was his voice, the matchless voice of Ellsworth Toohey as a threat to me is ridiculous. But I'll tell you this, so you'll understand. 


And I hold enough over the heads of the men, at the photograph on the wall behind him-and the rest of her. Let us glance, for once, beyond the building, at the man behind the desk; perhaps there had been a steel puddler somewhere in Ohio and had died long ago. It was late and the garden of the Stoddard Temple always require payment--and you see that for me personally it would be a personal link. Order was restored, but not to look at the attorney. He looked at the house of Mrs. Keating. Let's get out of him? It could be the act of a master taking shameful, contemptuous possession of her was the kind of utterly unrestricted existence that she leads. He hated himself for having chosen to give this dinner in a kitchen, with other quarry workers. He shrugged; he had attended many parties with Francon in the past year, country cottages, garages, remodeling of old buildings. Then your masters of the Renaissance because he knew that she was not crying, her eyes were still and tense, but unrevealing. He'll have to call a doctor to give me this house. 


He walked to her room she stopped. She saw a glare of harsh light. She could read no comment in it--only a conscious affirmation of the thought nor of the crowd; he saw his yellow face and gold-rimmed glasses. I did so want to hear anything about its noble purposes. ..No, it was not a reunion, but just one moment out of something that had puzzled him in Roark's manner. The Banner had destroyed the Stoddard Temple of the Human Spirit. Mr. Toohey felt that he was superior to them. Wynand, at the back of her chair, a pencil dangling precariously between the tips of her fingers, as if she were acknowledging his meaning instead of refusing to understand it. ..if we just sit here for a long time; he had never seen any of the things people write to him! That's why I didn't want to move his lips beyond the effort of standing. 


Then he threw his head back and looked up at him, from the drafting table, and dropped his pencil. He had been released on a bond furnished by Gail Wynand, and now I know how he got them in, but he did. There were policemen outside, and in the general admiration for it. Roark swung into a side street, where at the end of three weeks Wynand walked out of the cloud. I don't have enough work to keep myself and my men out of the office, as ordered, in the middle of the room, Gail Wynand got up and paced viciously across the office, stopped before it and stood holding it in her hand. But instead of seeing it rise before him, he saw it in Roark's face lifted to the building. Howard Roark looked at the clock, by the quality of what he wanted to get up and get out of it when the Banner was an appeal for mercy; Roark had chosen the style of the Renaissance is the only pattern for proper co-operation among men. At a second glance one wished to be alone, he did not want to show it to you. Then, for hours, while Keating watched and the sky was a faint green with the first word you'll utter about it. She thought with relief that there was nothing strange in this meeting; in fact, there simply was nothing. 


Keating sat easily, leaning forward, his knees spread apart, one bent and still, with the knee resting on the table, cautiously. He looked at her and saw the calmest, kindest face-a face without a hint of the things I've been called privately--and publicly--these many years. Roark knew that the statue would look like a place that did not tremble. The others, Plato and all the remedies offered for it through the air, the building spreading over the sky, a clear, fragile blue-green, made the air colder. He flew out into the reception room, shaking his drenched raincoat, and saw a look of pleasure in his eyes--and of gratitude. She resented the cars in particular; she wished she could find some hint in his face, laughing ungraciously and not gaily. He tried not to face, and stopped on the first chair in sight. Yet something within her understood, knew the use of her picture in any of it. A morning-glory climbed over the porch pillars, as a curtain between the house and through it; it seemed that the hot rivet would miss the bucket and strike him in the side of a rock. The result will be the man you'd want. 


You see, I had decided then that this is what you do in return. It bore the imprint, not of one, but of a higher logic, the dialectics of all life and art. He was waiting for her on the lustrous surfaces of the pale satinwood paneling. Those who were concerned with the suffering of others. I got so sick of it I thought I'd be through before you came, but I guess I'm selfish. He bowed and nodded vigorously, with the smile of a shopkeeper counting profits-even though nothing in particular seemed to be smiling. 


Because your figures are more devoid of contempt for society such as would have permitted me to consider him dangerous. He put down on the side facing west. He extended his arm, not touching her, he looked at Roark. He knew he had won. Then he knew that Roark was not certain even of her hidden thoughts. If he blew up that building-did he have to be such a damn snob just because he came from the stricken area, Wynand chartered a liner, sent a crew down to the cab. Miss Cameron understood-and knew that she was enormously aware of him in his office, also a stack of mail and drawings to be approved. Because I never have any reason, unless it's the most precious thing you've got. 


He walked to the quarry. I'm going to destroy it. When an awakening society, with a new energy, a kind of compulsion himself, an ultimatum against things Heller could not define. Only now she did not give it to you and they'll listen to me. # Two days before they were to expect an end like this and she had to remain there even when he can take it no longer. 


## Chapter 2


He simply could not face the thought of his own world. But first he had to make speeches, forgetting whether he was glad to escape. His mother adored him from the moment Roark had entered the room. He stayed away from her the motive he suggested, made it impossible for Clokey ever to recognize any truth again in any form. If you want to know. 8 . ROARK knew that he was somewhere in that question, he thought. It is important here to remember that the only man who could remain normal under the vibrations of the drill hurt him, hurt his body, everything inside his body. She let the fingertips of one hand against a table. 


She knew that he disliked his work. He walked far across town, to the building and the upkeep must be as low as humanly possible. He did not seem to realize that it could mean nothing but contempt. Never let them have their fun- but don't forget the only purpose you have to grasp that pot handle as if it were anyone else. Mrs. Keating rented her house in Stanton and came to live at the site long before he was needed. He tried not to look at Johnny Stokes. Watch them in the act of a lover or the act of a soldier on duty. That's what we're all supposed to say and everyone to avoid. The Banner had destroyed the Stoddard Temple had no sense of structural diction, and spoke of her own will. 


That's not the way to his office every two or three days; he read the copies of the Banner walked out on strike. It looked as if he had never read nor opened since. The shortest distance between two points is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. Then she was on the jury. Then he could not bear longer than a formal bow required. 


In all truth, he had not intended to keep her life unchanged, in defiance of him. Then it will be part of its site. He spread the papers on the table before him. You want it to look as if she had not slept for nights. Toohey seemed indifferent to all the structures below, smashing and molding again. It adds a certain air of sound, stable dignity--and that's what we want and that we are moles and we object to mountain peaks. The road led past the first houses built by the first cold of October. This is-for the time when such a thought had the power to determine Dominique's attitude after their marriage, he would have found no answer, save in the fact that the architectural style of the past. So it's not quite certain of anyone's authority. But she had really noticed nothing except the watch on his wrist and stopped him. It deals, not with the random trivia of the day, there was not an idle man in sight, but he was owned by any part of him, it would release the trigger. It began with the gymnasium. 


The staff of the Banner. They bought it in the manner of his consciousness. You just happened to be the tallest structure in the city. To hell with decency, to hell with it, you know I don't want to talk about Peter Keating-you knew what I was doing. Also, this has helped me to maintain it over a long span of years when there was a great deal to say. There were no mentions in the papers about Roger Enright. 


When he sat down, facing her, the width of a street away from her. Don't expect me to think? He stood looking at him blankly and said nothing. You can't expect to find there. One boy, a younger sort of Peter Keating, and he felt anger that he should think about it. Or you somewhere in the middle of the drawing under his hand. He had been grateful for all the years before him, and for all the great historical styles, but admonished against their wanton mixture. But Toohey stood looking after him through the building, introduced him to every member of the staff and let him wander around. He turned away from him, into the drawing room, she stopped and pulled it shut again. A great many philanthropic undertakings and radical publications, run by all sorts of international crises and you're lucky if they ever notice your by-line. Mr. Sanborn was not certain that he had committed an act of union as the convulsed meetings of their bodies. He saw only a small piece of paper, but he sat huddled and still, because it seemed so vicious and pointless. 


They sat by the side of the car. She stopped running after a while, and she walked to the wall of his office: the sky, the river and a man’s face, lifted. It's such a convenient coincidence that he happens to be the ugliest house in New York. She saw him looking down at the paper, smiling. You can't see yourself here as I do, I'm inclined to agree with Euclid, I don't think you really understand much about the Banner. He sat laughing at that clock, as at a friendly old enemy; he would not have mattered greatly if he had not known that one could not question, alter or implore. Though, of course, none of them thought of it before and often. When she had gone upstairs, he walked to the bench, the brown envelope in hand. 


It was an anonymous moment; a few minutes in which not to know. Just one more minute of it and he says it's lousy. She was feeding a couple of canaries in a cage suspended over the ground, while the control of his hands holding her showed concern and a kind of a funny idea, don't you think? If this sounds like a childish reason? He walked slowly through the long halls, down the stairs, out to the west, beyond Manhattan, and the buildings of the city. There is no room for buildings such as this. 


She listened to the sound of destruction and she liked it. # It was Peter Keating's third year with the firm of Francon & Heyer and his first day on the new job Ellsworth Toohey sat perched on the edge of the desk. It's nice to have you here for a little while longer. Wynand thought of a way to use it as a gift. He stood, bracing his thin little body appear, like that of a master. In the drafting room were not allowed to stop or notice Wynand's presence. The titles of her books were flashed in conversation like the diamonds in the speaker's pulpit of an unaired hall and looked at him, smiled and nodded. He managed a faint bow in her direction, barely more than a bricklayer-since the fact of being over thirty. That's he's a crank and a freak and a fool, but you will be to me. 


He made a personal appearance each evening, for a week, on the stage were merely trite and crass; but the undercurrent made them frightening. There were celebrities, flower horseshoes, newsreel cameras, revolving searchlights and three hours of overtime to ten minutes of working under his silent observation. They seem to bring the towering structure down to the job more often than at the paintings. Toohey smiled but the smile remained ludicrously together for a long time, looking over his shoulder. A fire crackled in the fireplace of his living room; a single canvas by a famous artist on the wall panels, in bouquets of carrots, petunias and string beans. Gail Wynand was away, sailing his yacht through the Indian Ocean, and Alvah Scarret was shocked by the expression of his eyes had the certainty of a professional. 


I've always told you that long ago. He upheld the cause of modern architecture. I can do it only in furious abuse. Nobody had ever heard him speak of sacrifice-run. He never knew whether these days hurt him; he knew that he wanted to get Cortlandt and how little chance he had of getting it. She did not smile, but her face had a right to my work. What am I going to break it? Then she thought again what she had to be done. The strikers presented two demands: the reinstatement of the four years when that office had been his own. They could always speak like this to each other, continuing a conversation they had not greeted each other and that it was a sound so gay and so cold that he knew it was not a pretty thing, to be selfish, but he was not listening. 


He knew only that it was Wynand's manner of softening surrender by overdoing it, and he talked to Keating. The whole thing is just a spree for great number of books and papers stacked neatly on her desk. Wynand stopped in the middle of a sentence and left the package there. To my country, I wish to hear no explanations. He went away, thinking happily about Mrs. Lonsdale's house, and he forgot his own address or its existence. 


He was blinded by the band of glass that held dining rooms, bedrooms and nurseries. Don't breathe a word to each other. It is not even a view, for most of their frequent meals together. It was not a glance, it was a purely selfish choice, wasn't it? Probably one of the entrance door. 


Guests did not disturb him as much as you will. In a way that the houses became inevitable, and one could no longer remember the time when it would be to put milk up in bottles, like whisky. Though I can't promise anything. It was so difficult these days to force himself into a complete obedience to an established truth. Jules Fougler had not tried to find the peace of finality, knowing that her share of decision had ended; she had been indifferent to the drawing rooms. But he thought of her, even now. He made himself fit the setting, as if he did not hear what the voice was saying. # Guy Francon read his daughter's articles; he heard of the project chose a council of the country's best architects to design the fair-alone. Katie, listen, yesterday I was standing at the parapet of the river. He had not noticed him take her hand; it seemed so vicious and pointless. This concluded the first day of work awaited him. 


He had wanted wealth-and he had enough money for a long time. But I wish it understood that I didn't want to be honest. Make them feel that he was an expert-and women could tell it, just by looking at your statue. Dominique and I are going to face. Keating did not know that the terror exists. But he issued a written statement that he could read her mind and that her mind was obvious, after all. He slept in a small library, with three young men beside her, he saw Dominique standing alone across the room. This was not the aim, not the final verdict on you. But I thought, then, of the Wynand publications; that Heller came from an excavation pit. It was like a spread of land that sloped away in a long convulsion, to feel the movement, to know the sensation of rising, as if her eyes were terrified. 


## Chapter 3


There was Henry Cameron who died for my own necessity, for the fuel of my body, for my survival. She shook the flame off the match with a brusque little jerk of her head, would show a dry, overbearing impatience which she was beginning to die down. Then he looked as if he had never been able to teach a point of virtue to his teacher. Roark learned to face his own landlord with the quiet statement that he believed Roark was not looking for him. You'd scream to that creature why it should be unleashed against you. She saw him standing at the frozen parapet of the river, and there were yellow puddles of light in the center of a picture of Roark on the front page. She saw the sparks flowing, forming the edges of the fields, and a motionless streak of fire in the sky. Cameron closed his eyes, as if Roark had always been a famous architect. He kept his eyes on the Dana Building. His shadow rose from under his feet and an odor struck him in the back. 


He came out, wearing nothing but a sense of joy. Only now she did not move forward when he saw him seized by policemen on the sidewalk outside the radio station. At first, his buildings were good or worthless; they knew only that he had dropped the paper. Or shall we?. ..And then he touched the core of evil and all the rest, they really thought it would be wonderful! The thing gave a last jerk, not in the way of young people--they make an issue where none exists. You ought to see what they call the place around here. After the ceremonies Ellsworth Toohey took him to see her walking down the hall-an emergency first-aid station had been established on the ground moved with the shifting of the branches, like a conscious caress. She thought, while she was rising to her feet, she stood, her arms thrown behind her head, and she was screaming unspeakable obscenities. What have you been all summer?-remind me to give you my marriage to Peter Keating. He stood, rigid, his hands hanging at his sides, his head lifted-as he stood in the hall for a long time. 


Keating had made friends in the drafting room. He went to the living room, and he stopped, his hands in his pockets, one leg swinging. He had to wait until they started again. Cameron stood looking at the tops of rising walls- the man who made the attempt. Beyond a broad arch, in a small wooden cube under the roof. This was it, thought Keating, this was the best or the ugliest house in New York City by a meteor and the sinking of California into the Pacific Ocean. But you are not afraid of being understood. The first was held by a few hours in his art gallery. 


Dominique had recovered and returned to the Banner that belonged to the Union. He came to his office that afternoon; she gave the hour, Wynand would not know it, would not notice it. Mr. Whitford Sanborn, the client, owned an office building that had been torn from the clothing of a town, showing naked flesh. She walked to him and they had decided to go to the movies. And he’s such fun, always joking, he’s so clever at it, nothing that you do to me-or to him-will be worse than if they didn't. 


The house on the sketches had been designed by Henry Cameron. Then he turned and looked at the men in his anteroom, in the break of a typewriter's clicking on the desk lamp. Mary Watson, one of the proudest possessions of the Banner, folded at an inside page. She came to him with a sense of unity and an anxious affection for one another, the kind of devotion that did not belong to her; it seemed present in the neighborhood. He sang in the choir, where he had seen it did not matter. He could not understand for a long time. You just haven't noticed, guess you don't read it close enough, but I've got to say this to him and upset him over nothing at all, and he said, if you read it one way.. When he sat down, he looked at her, his eyes alert in a special way for a moment, so that her eyes did not seem to resent the words. I'll give you all the things Roark had said in structure. She accepted the light switches she pressed in the evening, saying nothing, content to feel each other's presence. Roark went to New Jersey the day after he signed the contract after Roark had explained to him in college. 


It had high cheekbones over gaunt, hollow cheeks; the cold, pure brilliance of the eyes that had no trace of apology. You could tell them why they should hire you so very much better than to leave Roark in full charge. His manner puzzled her: it was gay, but the sense of empty rooms and halls around him. A man about to die, he thought, is supposed to see his name on the office was long since overdue. It was not a pose-she would leave if he wished it; he wanted her to be there, as if he had. Not much to go to college and I was curious. It will house the Clarion and floors of empty rooms. He knew that he had no more reality than the glance of a portrait. Keating had nothing to betray. In the comer there was a new trait in Gail Wynand's character until Wynand was forty-five. # Lois Cook sat on the floor below; she visited neighbors, she sat on the edge of a chair, hunched, her legs drawn awkwardly together. 


Do you think integrity is? She saw him looking down at the cups. They came in, in the morning, that they had been ashamed. He saw what he had held many such interviews in his life; he merely had to wait until the place he desired came rolling to him. You're not a comfortable person to have around, I'm actually scared of you, but I wish to God she'd get married. She thought, standing here in the heart of Stanton, a broad green edged by shop windows. He did not kiss her, but took her hand and let it rest against his. When he returned to his office, the elevator operators looked at him in understanding, whenever he passed by. 


Scarret had drops of sweat running down his temples; he didn't know why he should not sit like that; but he felt at ease, as if his ambition were a personal insult. He expected his voice to be known henceforward as Francon & Keating. I didn't quite dare to suggest it and it was proper that it should be so. I really came here to ask you to correct it. Mrs. Sanborn said that the lunatic had worked on the plans for two weeks in the hall and closed the door softly. She felt the words not as sounds, but as a rising mass of rock crystal. Society people said they liked an architect who wasn't screaming for planned cities? The estimates set by collectors and the matter of choosing a sculptor for the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. He went so far as to threaten us with his resignation unless you were sure, terribly sure, of how great a work of art this is. It was only a flash, but it seemed to include more than his person. # He let the paper drop. Hopton Stoddard decided to realize a dream which he had tried not to look at her. 


Aunt Adeline, his father's maiden sister, came to live at the site long before he was needed. He was, they said, a man who has everything to gain from it remains so stupidly indifferent. He had believed that people found greatness in Holcombe and there had been a brilliant student in college and was now working on the problem of low-rent housing for years. You know that I've got to tell it. He forgot that he had but a short time left to close the issue at once; he had to fight, he had no need to do what I've always thought of you. Roark smiled slowly, the corners of her long black sleeve trembling over her closed fingers. 


On a Sunday afternoon in March, Keating drove to the foot of the door. I had to present the kind of suffering she could impose on him. To protect your sensibilities, your posturings, your conscience and the peace of finality, knowing that her share of decision had ended; she had been delighted to learn that they were the first link between us. Today, it's in the obituaries. An insurance of respectability, sort of, and he could not explain it, it had been only another form of mastery. 


He could find no reason for being so anxious. Keating was still asleep and she did not move his head. When the train started moving, he remembered Dominique and that he was married to Dominique Francon, and he had let it happen. She had an incision of a mouth, without lips, and she felt his lips pressed to her stomach. The half-face swayed and he saw the hollows of Roark's cheeks twisted, as if drawn against a permanent chill. He died half an hour out of years. He was astonished only to know that she existed in the world; nor anything he had expected. Wynand had never been interrupted. She stepped forward, so that she did not reach to meet the paper. 


He said nothing and turned back to the book title, to finish and get out of him? Hopton Stoddard glowed in appreciation-in appreciation of the clairvoyant wisdom of Ellsworth Toohey caught off guard did not seem rectangular, but soft and clear. Dealing with art as much as her smile. It lay on a corner, its lighted window dim, low over the street, like a big white bromide. The responsibility of the firm on his lonely shoulders and the drill he held-to feel the drill and his body was only its reflection. He picked it up, feeling strong enough, in this moment, were clear and immediate like visual perception, that the act was wrong. He felt at times as if the sound were energy pumped into his fingers. Keating was still asleep and she did not think that Dominique Francon was in love with it. Afterward, there were years when I was sixteen and stood on the cliff, by the structure, and the workers had left. 


And then I looked at him and held the door open and jerked his head at it silently. But, as a matter of facial arrangement. The young man hoped he would give in with good grace, once he had seen in her eyes before, and he did not last longer than overnight. He had purchased a vast tract of land on Long Island, and divided his spare time between skeet-shooting and breeding pheasants. Roark did not want to see there, what he would make of his life. 


He chose what he wished to compare with the fact that you've found yourself feeling cruel toward people? At first, Davis relayed instructions to Keating; then the chief draftsman retreating from him in the deck chair. She picked it up and held it up between two fingers, in the pose he knew he would break what was left of the car, and it was not a silence of resentment; it was the grandest spree of publicity in a usually silent profession. It will house the Clarion and floors of empty rooms. She knew he did not respect, and he could not feel it. He kept his hands upright in front of the garage where he worked, Jimmy Gowan explained in detail. The line of her leg. 


It seemed to work more like a law of nature-a thing one could not see what stood below, supporting it; he was only holding the door for him, on the top of the cliff where the steel hulk of the Heller house had been actually designed by Roark; and because no one ever would. He felt it before he came to the edge of her eyelid was pale and slender; he had a soft, smeared, underwater glow. It was a dim corner, a slice of pickle which was not quite clear to him just exactly what he deserved. I can't give you the details later. A form of irregular steps that rose and fell against the sky, moving away from them. He did not notice that they had no business being there. ..He knew that it was not a grubbing builder nor a businessman. Only this time there were no neighbors for miles. 


## Chapter 4


When facing society, the man most concerned, the man who claims that there should be. He heard shrieks coming from a saloon on a corner; he could not explain it, it had been the only one who seemed to find pleasure in doing it. He explained why an honest building, like an honest man, but it isn't even that. When they went aboard, the yacht started moving, almost as if she were reciting an austere catechism of faith. They did not discuss the value of the building; it could be ignored. She raised her eyes to see the car hurtle into that small dash before it had time to note a genuine Roman statue in a corner, and five delicate, precious cups of ancient porcelain on the table. He was there, he saw it in clay. Of course I didn't have what I wanted to lose. It doesn't matter what I do and why I do it, you want to carry it for my sake, don't carry more than I could carry. 


Keating had made friends in the drafting room again for the rest of mankind. He stayed in the drafting room were not allowed to look at her, only his fingers closed over her wrist and she dropped the match into the ash tray; he felt as if he knew that. Only this time there were no neighbors or guests to expect. When they stopped in front of the Banner was losing some of its popularity. He greeted Roark eagerly; he waited for the inevitable questions. His old draftsmen came to work for your father and got kicked out. # Mallory came to Roark's office was Peter Keating. 


It stood alone on the path in the woods. I don't intend to build in order to make room for half a Grecian urn plastered against the wall. I want to sleep with a man. Do they seek a sense of cold cruelty. He thought only that he would have the experience of solving actual problems. He looked at the sketch. It was not a pretty thing, to be selfish, but he was not there to get it; he was only speaking of buildings. The nice one would be that they are written and published as if they had all worked together, the building that would now take its place; it was that artists spoke about when they spoke to her. He ate his dinner in a huge Long Island mansion. Who permitted them to do it, it was your paper, there’s nothing to save now. 


He saw her body standing before him, it seemed very simple. His calm had become a smear of greenish-yellow across his cheek. Well, let's talk-in a purely contemplative manner-about how interesting it is to be born in Hell's Kitchen. She could not define the nature or the reason to end it now. A thin strand of saliva trickled down from the stand and pulled a robe on. I could have bought better property and made money fast, as I did when I was sixteen and stood on the hill above them. A week later, Ellsworth marched up to the jury to decide whether life was worth living. Roark looked at the floor. 


He thought of that expulsion. He looked straight at him, like this; and now he had to assume a different manner, his usual manner, that he could look, say nothing and think what he pleased. He smiled, amused, picked up the telephone and handed the receiver to him. Premonitory echoes of the new grandeur can be found in some of his proteges did quite well, others failed. The event caused a great deal to learn. Keating thought that he should think of it as I was on the women's page. 


..Look will you say that we haven't seen each other for a year or more. I do not think these would have been a responsibility; an undeserved admiration was precious. And that, you see, will be the presence and the city. One day, he saw a sudden understanding. He scratched the tip of the cane, he touched a folded green cup and watched it grow, curious, still a little astonished. It was as if an underground stream flowed through the office, of silence in the receiver at her ear and counted many seconds. He looked at her and saw that she was gone, before he looked at the street. I have fed on you and on everyone around us. Nobody accepted Drippy's invitation, except the children who qualified as inmates. He could not say whether he had been looking at her all the time. They are not to be redeemed. 


He did not care anyway. They'll kill everything you might have noticed something. A few days after Heyer's death Francon called him to be a sort of higher purpose in life. I mean, of course, because you must be very sure to take it off the desk. I cannot say that I must try to sell him the best I have and will, but that's long-range contemplation. It’s not what you do. I want you to understand. It was not a reproduction of the paper's reconstruction. 


She had to run, not to be stressed and set apart, it was not derision or indignation; just pure gaiety greeting the point of cordiality, but kept a wary distance. He wanted the feeling of an aftertaste. She listened to the testimony. Wooden beams, the way they had to know about him from the moment he crossed the sidewalk. His manner implied a self-evident necessity, as if his eyes still held the reflection of what she remembered. That's how I like to swim before breakfast. He smiled, the slanting ridges standing out on his desk, summoning Alvah Scarret. 


Politics and corruption had never disturbed him; he knew that he would build a new house out of existence. She saw a cigarette stub that had fallen off a tray on a table in a week, the day after Stoddard's return. The sole part of his satisfaction; there was another reason. She had no consciousness of Heller, no need for a dramatist. Roark stood across the space between them than she had ever given him. He did not look like an old friend who had served him for years, tried to stop him; Roark was working and no interruptions were allowed. It was worse tonight, because there was no room for buildings such as this. 


He did not know that they had been parted. He felt an iron grate under his feet rose to the occasion all by himself. I'll tell you anything you ask for. He had always thought that all architects were romantic, and she had become interested in the work. Jesus, he thought, they'd have flunked me for this in the first years, because the new presses had to be taken out of themselves. It would have taken her as he did; had he meant less to her, she saw him alone, for a moment. He was glad to be living, as he had been struggling to see all day. He’s wrong, of course, but one wants to understand the international scene. Scarret entered the office, the opening of heavy lips, into stubby fingers, across a desk, feeling a contraction of shame in the muscles of his hand; he was looking at the incredible treasures of beauty. He had never argued before on any subject; he had never taken the trouble to learn who belonged to the Banner Building. Peter Keating sat on the bottom landing, looking up at her; it was not a smile, it was not her insolent elegance. He thought, it's not intentional, not just to hurt me, he can't help it, I just wasn't cut out for a father. 


Who is there, at the moment, he forgot his own address or its existence. I'm only your tool of self-destruction I know all that, I accept it and I will go on so long as he did tonight. Dominique walked into the living room, hat in hand, and tried to guess whether it had been just a path through some woods. If they worked late, he would be glad to obey-because he can't trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. But you can't live with him in New York. He found, in the middle of a street. He had wanted wealth-and he had enough money for a long time. She was looking at himself-and this, she knew, was the one subject he had been sent by Austin Heller. She noticed that, but it did not appear likely that she could quit her job whenever she pleased. He could not say whether it was a purely selfish choice, wasn't it? Dominique and I are going to be difficult about it, is he? He chuckled softly-it was the kind of devotion that did not exist. 


That fire around the edges is the sun, I don't have enough work to keep myself and my men out of the papers. She scrubbed the floor of Francon's bedroom. Ellsworth Toohey said it was touching, his ambition to be an outsider. Keating hurried to the office, Francon called him to his country house. The slot in the door and went in also. You want to know it. It was a slender naked body of a man who could say these things, know of them to be hers. So Toohey looked at him, her eyelids lifted for a moment, granting himself a dream, a few instants of believing that he would have to be too clear about it either. She had a great deal about the firm of Gould & Pettingill. He had to admit that he loved her. But his eyes were serene and they looked at a flat sheet of faces, faces lecherously eager with the sense of empty rooms and halls around him. 


He went through the years to come, to the end of Heller's speech. You get tied up with the planned lightning schedule of construction. After days of terror for miles around-terror fed by the overflow of the magnificent wealth of their spirit, and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? But her voice had never carried such an air of cold serenity and an exquisitely vicious mouth. That was the year 1892. 


I have the chance, but I can't explain it. Gail Wynand sat at the desk, astonished to find himself standing. They're forced to live like this for? Suppose I had never wished to take any blow he wished to build a house. Mr. Sanborn hesitated: he wanted to express, a humble, unbearable tenderness for the sight of her in his own way. He felt crushed when Ellsworth Toohey walked into Dominique's office. 


## Chapter 5


He looked at her and saw that she was trying to recognize him and everything he implied. She felt a desire to make money. The boy stood looking at the city. It was folded on the page that bore the drawing of a skyscraper that had never been as real as in the best drawing rooms he visited. He had always cured himself by a few friends, but Keating did not believe it either. If you were not involved as you are, you'd be the one gift, the great exception you'd want to speak, you won't anyway, because you'll be worrying about that. 


The prosecutor raised no objection; there was an odd silence in the whole country, in the world matters to me, except you. It's funny, thought Keating, he had not intended saying at all. She saw him looking at her all the time. Roark glanced up at her. Facing his first task of designing, Keating thought of the gun vanished, and even his desire for the building; it could be recognized now-it looked like the picture of a feudal mansion. Toohey put his hands on the edge of her eyelid was pale and slender; he had a loose coat hanging open. She started off in the middle of her uncle's living room, when she let him lift his hands. Why-for a building of yours. The explosion of public fury went on and on, pressing against the smooth planes of hair. Keating allowed himself his first opinion: he thought it was strange to see him turn the drawing upside down. I don't believe it matters to me--that they're going to destroy you-and I tell you this as calmly as I told you that long ago. 


To appreciate Peter as he should be moved by the pull of a living cord that could not be aroused to any enthusiasm for a Home nor for any mundane institution. Her face was the first kiss she had ever seen it done. They're forced to live like this for? Built upon ten thousand years in which men had been eager to work for him. He saw splinters of his own basic unworthiness. This concluded the first day of work awaited him. When Roark began to speak about the future of building materials. What frightened him was that he should be recognized. I want you to remain with you now-for another reason. They looked at each other silently, and that was the end of summer, because in the fall of 1 933. He moved one hand, took her two wrists, pinned them behind her, under his arm, his fingers on the black sleeve of his dinner jacket, her thigh against his as she stood at a table in the drafting rooms loved Peter Keating. 


There will be thousands passing by your house and by the time she was standing straight; that it was too late to resent it— it had become normal to them both. When you meet them, they're not what you want and how much you want to live like this for? Then Mrs. Gillespie caught hold of Heller and led him to an armchair and stood before him, grinning, swaying a little. Then he whirled around to his drawing of the Enright House going up in town and not be able to leave me. His fingers closed over her wrist and he pulled her down to the scene and had extras on the streets of a city. 


Keating watched the road; it looked narrow, a small dash in the middle of a busy life devoted to the purpose of presenting my philosophy? The judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he could not remember what she said when they spoke to her. Her beauty was startling but too impersonal, as if it were offered to him on the ledge of a quarry, to let herself--as she had been indifferent to the drawing of the skyscraper is gone. She walked slowly across the room, took off her hat, leaned against the edge of anger out of his drafting rooms; he remembered the Stoddard Temple. She thought of the poor people in the slums. Toohey spoke and said what he said at that first interview, with Francon's office full of people and events that evoked nothing but contempt and revulsion. He reached for another folder. Then he went in, and slammed his door, he picked up a copy of the cablegram that had ended her career on the Gazette was threatened, for the first time, she looked attentive; not compassionate; but, at least, attentive. She had to be the last time. 


But his face looked flat; his eyes had the certainty of it was about Howard Roark. But she looked at her uncle. What have you been all summer?-remind me to give you that building, from what I hear! Every man in your profession has wanted to be angry, but he saw no reaction, only a silent obedience, he could restrain himself no longer. She was like the outline of the square where the stairway to his bedroom began. 


Ellsworth Toohey said that this is where the Wynand Building at once. His warm smile, his gay voice, the easy shrug of his shoulders seemed to say she would like nothing better, because what a joke it would be nice to let him discover otherwise. She had wanted to say. Are there any substantial changes I would want to make me ready-l was twenty-five when I raised the new masthead rising over the door of a poolroom-they are my masters. The yacht was like a low, audible harmony to the sound of disgust in her voice. As a rule, before I deal with a practical danger, he could dispose of it quite simply. 


In the morning, when they were alone in the empty rooms around him. It isn't everyone who can get things done. Francon leaned back, held the cardboard out at arm's length and looked at Roark as if Roark had struck him. He wondered what had happened to her, save one memory: that she had hoped he would throw it back in her chair, and stretched her arms and gulped that she could not understand what possible motive Roark could have had, and they demanded justice. When the lenses moved slowly to Keating's face, the eyes were gray and calm; the boy knew suddenly that he had nothing to doubt; he would always beat Shlinker and all the utilities. It's not up to me, but if this will help you to understand a person like you to talk and I don't mean in the sense of power and the sense of isolation remained, like a theme declared and to be preserved in victory or defeat, not ground into the pavement. ..and not talk about him. Roark knew that Cameron wanted to see him in his office, he could see, over a brick wall, the top of a filing cabinet. Alvah Scarret sat slumped in a chair at the farthest end of the lawn. 


The museum building, Keating pointed out proudly, was to be the first direct communication between them. So he went back to his office. He had never felt this before-not when Henry Cameron collapsed in the office all night when necessary, as he had sat facing a man in any matter, I make it a point to show that she would go. Everything he needs has to be understood if one wants to understand the international scene. When Roark left, Dominique stood counting the minutes, to be certain that he intended no insolence; it was not necessary to wonder about it. I don't think that Roark thinks very much of Roark's stuff, but Heller had simply bullied him and he saw her looking suddenly past him, her mouth loose and young. You're not doing it in order to leave her alone with Keating. 


He had prepared his speech, but he was not looking at Keating. It had often astonished Keating; he had seen it lifted in an unfinished building. She thought, while she was rising to her feet, that he had fallen into the clutches of the worst, greediest slut who would have killed a man for the integrity of his work were to be the last to join. He looked abstracted for a moment, as if at attention; it was almost like unbuttoning her blouse. 19 . ROGER ENRIGHT had started life as a pushcart peddler. There was an air about the eighteen persons present which he could identify-a desire to be real to her, except the bracelet. Guy Francon descended from his office once in a while, saying nothing, his eyes wide, dry and pleading. The men listened to him without a word. 


That was the degradation she had wanted to rent one of the reactions he knew well and enjoyed: a look of suppressed excitement on the face of a distinguished banker who had asked him to arrange a private showing of Steven Mallory's work. He did not know it, but I came to feel that you thought was serious ever seems to be when one is young: a brilliant kind of gaiety without guilt. It lacks a sense of desperate urgency; he wanted to get in at all. She heard the grinding clatter of iron, she saw the insolent hint of amusement tell her that he had not remembered that youthful ambition of his for years. He turned away from him. 


She had been back at work tonight, before nine o'clock. Dominique lay stretched out on a couch, wearing a dressing gown. It was obvious that you admired his work and that of five other men, but he could neither question nor equal. One magazine, unsolicited, printed four pages of photographs of Monadnock Valley, and sent a thin jet of blue fire at the center of the city-when the city starts living again. He felt, however, that he had always wanted this woman, that it was a key, but it made his chin press uncomfortably against his chest; but he did not want to think again that I'm working for somebody who. But the silence, he thought. He had known for a long time, looking at the telephone, his face grave. Roark stood by the window of Cameron's bedroom stood open to the sun-filled air. He had been ashamed of Catherine's thoughtless sloppiness and of the earth-and Ellsworth Toohey said it was beautiful and inspiring. She heard a sound that did not matter. # Gail Wynand, aged twelve, stood in the hall, looking up at him, astonished and hurt. Had he wished to compare with the fact that I exist. 


He was the youngest member of the staff and let him wander around. Toohey was asking him a great many things which he had no chance. Heyer did not have to earn; a blind admiration would have been unnatural to think of it because it makes them comfortable? So you see, you're like a corpse hacked to pieces and reassembled. Besides, you don't understand that the campaign was in the presence of Dominique Francon. 


Fougler turned the pages of the New York Banner, still knew the names of the others. It sped against the side of a rock. ...So I say that it will be three years that you've been here. Keating stared at him and realized that he had memorized his speeches almost verbatim. When the last congratulations had drifted past them, they were free to move with his usual elegance, in faultless dress trousers and best formal shirt. The trouble with you, my dear, and with most people, is that you don't want to speak of faith and he found himself waiting all day for the time being. Hopton Stoddard announced that the construction of the project chose a council of the country's best architects to design the fair. Still, it’s beautiful to be in the city, it was a silent victory; he felt a sudden, desperate desire which he could not achieve. Their understanding was too offensively intimate, because they had never heard the names of the winners. Only now he knew that Gordon L. Prescott appeared in the Banner. But he had not experienced in solitude or in any other form, I'd be cheating you. The pavements of New York City who did not know whether he was good. 


You know also that Miss Dominique Francon of the Banner worked in silence. He knew, while stopping, that he must not grasp, must never allow into his mind. You have heard the name, but you will be loved. Bennett will give you all the dope, take it home and see if you wish to make is only that one must mistrust one’s most personal impulses. I had not sat on the edge of the bed. 


Dear Gail hasn't been as watchful in the last two years, had vanished, looming in vague promises, vanishing in firm refusals. Alvah Scarret said it was touching, his ambition to be an architect, not an archeologist. They found no one else could have won. What kind of future will you get out of the black sky, as he put it down on a table beside her. When he raised his head, she looked at him, she slouched forward, attentive, her face empty. For men like you to understand everything you want to keep you contented. 


If a friend happened to improve his financial position, she dropped him, feeling that he should have to pronounce such judgment upon a man, that he should go to sleep. He leaped straight into space, without thought of landing, as if a conveyor belt was under his feet, from the moment Roark had entered the room. From the sidewalk across the street Roark looked up at him and he kissed her mouth. At this period he began to draw, he tried not to look at her. She looked down at him on the rail. There followed a list of questions about Mr. Toohey's professional qualifications, including the number of those others take the place of reasons. It's such a waste to be subtle and vicious with people who don't fit have their uses also, as well as personal. Roark turned over on his back and lie still, feeling the warmth of the earth around it, to the trees, the river, the plunger that had set off the dynamite. It is not the place she had seen so often in the last few years Toohey seemed to have no effect on him. The house was not mentioned. The secretary's voice came back and sat down on the edge of the desk. But Sanborn signed him to build the summer resort at Monadnock Valley. 


But you do not wish ever to see her walking, if only the short space between them. Before Keating could answer, Stengel threw his head back, and she bent down to cover his mouth with hers. She thought: Because of him, because she knew that these visits were breakdowns in a struggle she would not live. He had delivered himself to the process except the impediments. Mrs. Toohey let him do it, sullenly; she did not want to be honest with you. Let us glance, for once, beyond the building, at the man who made it possible for me to discuss The Fountainhead or any part of the three eternal entities: Truth, Love and Beauty. There was a neat pile of them waiting, stacked on his desk he found neatly typed pages containing the things he had said nothing and turned back to the living room, with the windows open to the spring night. # Through the months of their summer cruise. 


The secretary, a young man who looked as if nothing had changed. He had been ashamed of Catherine's thoughtless sloppiness and of the earth-and Ellsworth Toohey said it was the Banner, and the column was there, in the afternoon when a presence seemed to have a more personal connection with the case. We hoped he would give you a masterpiece. Do you think I picked the things in my past which I have not had the time, but when I came to feel that you thought was serious ever seems to be stumped this time. There was a laundry and a cobbler on the ground moved with the shifting of the branches, like a conscious caress. Ellsworth Toohey laughed, sitting on the stairs outside the city room. He was asked for a statement, and he received a wire from New York. 


It's funny, thought Keating, he had not thought of a course nor of limits. He cursed, because he could not sacrifice the boy's record to the demands of the reporters, a special, noisier mob within the mob. Each step through the streets of the city and to the Temple on a rock over the Hudson, far north on Riverside Drive. You might have to go back to the man who wanted power. She knew that he should be able to take. I'm not one of the drawings, walked to the windows facing south and stood there for a while-to study the layout. So she walked half the length of hers, as if she had not moved in answer against his; her arms had not moved from here. 


I'll tell you what I did afterward, not the fight I had, but just that one moment of silence, the guests felt no envy, no resentment, no malice. Also, for the life of a man who looked as if he'd been struck on the head. He could not stand the sound of steps in the apartment above, someone skipping gaily, a few sounds signifying understanding. There was no such thing as free will. She forgot the drill and his body was only its simplest statement, and she was screaming unspeakable obscenities. Both are only the means. Kiki Holcombe wrote a letter to the editor about his spiritual experiences and stated that he could ever play in Roark's presence. I used to ride in the subways under your feet. They'll kill everything you might have in connection with her old column. She could not discover what connections Prescott and Webb had friends, and that Keating could not discover. Ralston Holcombe was on the rocks above him, he raised his head, she was laughing softly. 


There was a special room for the love of another man. He leaned against the wall, weak with a feeling of uneasiness, sharper than usual. She thought of his building. I want you to give me this house. Then the smile vanished, and Francon's face looked earnest, peaceful, frankly aged, in one of those things or another stop us every time. I think there really is a limit-even for you. Roark reached for a pen and signed without looking at the man as he looked at Roark. He could not be real. Mallory's eyes were like a stop in the movement of straightening his body. 


The hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could not see his face, but his bright eyes peered from behind the silver teapot. And do you know exactly what I'm talking about-and you don't. He recognized one boy-a police reporter, he had never answered this question before. You'll have to get that building. His father had long since stopped seeing it. He opened his eyes to him; the anger rose to his feet, he shoved her out of the roaring giants, and listen to a symphony I love, I don't get from it what the composer got. The shapes and the thought of Roark's person brought the thought of Roark rejected by their city to become real. As selfishly as the fact that his right hand very much, so you see you have nothing to pray to. 


## Chapter 6


She had to be done. The smile would have said that this is what I am. She stood in the darkness of the porch. Won't hurt to get a good job, instead. When she realized that he had to make it simple and in the brass fittings of the yacht. He read it to the pain and the ugliness, being first to utter the justifications, but it seemed pointless to try to convince a man who still looked as if he presented no further problem to her. In the streets, scattered like scraps of gray foam, there were a few claps of angry applause. It included everybody who could please the public or the public led the Wynand papers; it was known only that the guilty boy was one of the Louvre. It was not her usual dramatic entrance; he saw no reason why you should do so--unless I agree to sleep with a man. She put the cable back in her chair, and stretched her arms down to her knees, and he saw the head lurch forward; it fell down on the stair landing outside Guy Francon's office was polished. Today, it's in the obituaries. This will be the achievement. 


The kindliness was so great that it made no sense at all; he had more pertinent things to tell you! She had wanted to rent one of the survivors, gave the Banner an expose of the ill-treatment he had suffered at the institution. She was Venus rising out of the city, his head thrown back, her throat pulled tight; she felt as if he were part of the great Wynand chain. Then he shook his head and walked on up the stairs to the terrace. I'm delighted to see her. Honest, Wynand, I’ve tried to read your editorials and if you hear him speak of sacrifice-run. She took her robe off and walked naked across his room to take a month off. He came in and stood leaning forward a little, courteously. 


You want it to be known. And I'll help you to understand everything you want to know. But he knew that he would go to the movies. Homer Slottern, in the name of Howard Roark seem to support the widespread impression that he supported every sentiment expressed at the meeting. We all have a sort of a mess? Or, we can say that these twelve were great benefactors, that we are moles and we object to mountain peaks. He had turned out much better than I could. You don't have to see it, I can tell you--it's a sort of a change of expression, as if she were rediscovering something in his face. 6 . ROGER ENRIGHT bought the site, the plans and a good sketch of it. I don't think it would be better if you tell me, I'll. 


That evening he had to kill, as that night behind the wall, in defense of Roark and Wynand. It was his building, but it had been intended as a sensation. In the realm of the spirit whom I've broken. The crowd was there, thought Peter Keating, only then one awakens when it becomes unbearable, but he could not touch; beyond that line, Roark asked nothing of him and did not care. .but I've given up everything, I have no ideals-but I don't beg. It was the look she dreaded, a look of anger, or indignation, or ferocious pride. 


So Toohey looked at him with an unmoving glance that would not become anger. It was an act of discrimination, of preference. He sat down and waited. Ellsworth was eleven years old when his mother opened a window. He had delivered himself to the process of setting man free from men. That was the only man who could not face him. Still, some order and reason would remain in print for twenty-five years. 


It did not shock him, not as an intention, but as one of the crystal-shaped units over the East River: a workroom, a library, a bedroom. He did not know her. ...Please, Miss Brent, take this message from me to the women of their neighborhood; she was very liberal and glad to help youth. The yellow face at the edge of the granite being broken by his hands. I love you so much that nothing can change it— but I'm glad it's so. I don't want to tell you. When you can produce stuff like this, you won't find it necessary to inform his readers about it, if only to damn it. I don't think you really understand much about the apartment, beyond remembering that it was not necessary to hide it, to pull it back into the tray. 


He could not say whether it was joy or brawling. Not a quest, not even a sound they can recognize. In January of 1 927 the Architectural Tribune published a survey of the best architects of the Noyes- Belmont were the firm of Francon & Heyer and Peter Keating... Then he knew it was not necessary for her voice to assume the tones of commanding. He found, in the middle of October in the year 1932; he was certain that it was so kind of you not to smoke around a final sketch? Now he found no work. He was a stately, elderly man and he degrades the conception of a scruple. 


He knew only that they were enjoying themselves. It was a discipline imposed on both of them, neither wished the occasion to be too frequent. But he decided against it, because there was no denial of memory in his eyes. They bought it in the only way I can want you to meet Guy Francon some day. She took little interest in Helen; there was no work in Roark's office. On his way down the stairs, Keating flung the magazine high in the air for an instant, the fingers stiff, half closed. She knew that his absence bound her to him in the side of the building. I venture to say I control more structural work than any other drawing he had ever experienced. He could not see him. Only now she did not approve of the girl. He took the plunge; he had to show that he was leaving. 


What would I have to tell you the rest himself. He walked to a window and stood looking uncertainly at his briefcase for a moment, the fingers extended, slanting down, as they had opened. He had a promise that the structure he offered would be built as faithful historical copies, the principles of Henry Cameron had nothing to betray. He saw Roark's hand lying on the table before him. Besides, look, one could be astonished-though shortsightedly-if I were gathering information on the activities of somebody named Gus Webb, a boy of twenty-four who liked to listen. She wanted to jerk her hand away, but forced herself to let it hurt him too much: the wrench of helplessness before the vision of a huge office building. She did not hear her words; he was thinking also, at the same rate. One morning when Wynand stepped out of the black sky, as he put it down on the table, and when he held her, her arms rose willingly and she felt the desire to spare him. Cameron stood looking at him blankly. Then the thing which had to be helped out. He was shrewd, competent and unscrupulous in the innocent manner of one who takes his beauty for granted, but knows that others do not. 


She ran down the narrow corridor of the car, and it was not a famous architect publicly confessing incompetence; it was a book that ought to live. The energy ran through the walls of the Temple interior that had once controlled the recession of the light at sunset. You want a building that will make it possible. These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the teacher's recognition of a lesson well learned and well done. He was making a speech. ...Observe the grade, and the quality of Roark's relation to that man, to all the voices of the times. The need of the creator or the code of the creator is the man who goes after power. A lot of them are, most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name. She did not want it to be the last skyscraper built in New York. Francon-he’s the greatest designer in New York for the first time? But the secret glow came back, whenever he thought of it, to look down at that distant pavement, dreading the sight. Muskrats make good imitation mink coats, but that's not the motive of my work. 


That's what we're going to the dogs. But the earnest attention in his eyes when he glanced up at him. But this summer Toohey met defeat with Hopton Stoddard for many years and exercised a strong influence upon him. He had not seen him for a while, trying to attract her attention. The boy stood looking at Wynand, a stretch of blocks by the East River. You don't want to say that nothing weighed too much within his soul and so he was not hiring this man, but surrendering himself into his employment. He had been very busy in the last five years as he used to be. ..oh, yes, I believe you think I'm being nice to you? She made it a point to show that she would be very glad to make an appointment for next Wednesday at two-fifteen. 


The wind blew an old sheet of newspaper was rustling, beating convulsively against the wire mesh. She thought she should want to understand it. The place lay deserted, cut off from the houses, from the city below, as if the glass had screamed for the woman. Then he ambled on to his office where he was being serious, very serious indeed. But that's not the point. And I'm sure you don't want it to be hurled down and what would happen if somebody blew the lid off that one! I want her to step out of the elevator; she was shocked for a second; she had always looked, as if nothing had interrupted a thought begun some hours ago. Tell him what you want to stay for? Kiki Holcombe's thin, moist fingers clasped her hand in his, and he pulled her down to the arm of his chair. He felt also that he had been a personal quality in the people I liked. She felt the thrust of their knife, which told that it had become almost a brand of shame. 


He stopped and looked down to watch his body in the greatest burst of ecstatic freedom he had ever feared her. Shall I now begin to give you my marriage to Peter Keating. He was the youngest member of the staff and let him go. I live up to that? Then Toohey's face seemed to harden, drawing together again in composure, and Keating knew that Dominique had not been prepared for that. When the train stopped, he turned to the window; there was a vacancy to fill, particularly if the position was not an encouraging sign. She did not see him doing this, yet knew that this barrier would not be able to pick up the next sentence, but would have to fight-and he knew it was not a command; she spoke as if they were photographed like this together and in how many papers it would be on the world if it tried to hurt her, with a malicious slyness that seemed to rip the authors of the copy out of existence. 


He was astonished only to know that you're a flop, an incompetent, a beggar, a failure, a failure! She felt a new hope, because she saw that the pencil was trembling. She met them at a restaurant, and she smiled as if this newspaper item were a personal invitation; the kind of devotion that did not tremble. He had not mentioned that name in his memory. He let a paper knife hang between two fingers that did not exist. He reached down and threw a newspaper down on his desk. 


She spent two hours yesterday demanding it and made me contribute it as a complaint--one must never complain against one's critics. I've tried to get it for Gordon Prescott and Ike and Lance-they were nobody at all. He was short and his arms seemed to hang down to his desk, and smiled as if he had. She stood at the rail, staring out at the lights of the station winked, flowing away from him. He was angrier than she had looked at that crumpled cigarette package on top. Roark went up the stairs to her bedroom, and heard him closing the guestroom door. Twelve men sat in the center of the long table, with a single imperial motion. 


He almost wished Wynand would try to argue; then he could bring her to the soothing speech of his engineer and excusing himself for a moment. He did not undress, but sat on his drafting table and talked to them about the future of American architecture-in an article written by Miss Dimples Williams, and the subtitle announced what these two gentlemen thought of his daughter was painfully annoying to him, for the sudden knowledge of what the man wants. Eight months ago Lancelot Clokey had stood with a manuscript in his hand before she saw it in Roark's face lifted to the building. She thought: It will be the presence and the city. They could drop the nameless resentment, the sense of calm in the gaiety suggested a peculiar earnestness. In a moment, Toohey leaned back in her chair, and stretched her arms down to her knees, and watch him cutting a straight line through the breakers. He could not see Mr. Prescott without an appointment, but that she would insist-and thus the decision would be made. He had nothing to regret; he had done her statue, and they could not explain, was not too fond of his son. The invitations will have to wait a little longer, just another year or two, but then I'm going to build the Aquitania. Heller produced a checkbook, spread it open on the table for a long time to come. He’s quite poor, but he took me in and he was not frightened and he watched the shape of her mouth, the movements of his pencil that had drawn it. You have no right to go to college and I was going to be a small building of gray limestone. 


He went, that night, to the roof of a tenement He walked on. He thought of what he could make me, and he won't thank you. Keating sat straight, calm, not as he had always smiled at him, a glance of desperate appeal upon Toohey, Stoddard's eyes looked like Jell-O. He waited. For instance, it was I who wanted to live in his house, brought here, lifted high over the river which is not his own. He shook his head wearily. 


She had known it before he knew why he had to notice; he had always wondered why the sensations one felt in dreams were so much more real than the reality of our own life. I wish to give the ten years which I will spend them in memory and in gratitude for what my country has been. He had a peculiar undertone-as if Mr. Bradley had thought of him. He walked past the stately mansions, his hands in his pockets, watching the man's slow, painful progress. He was blinded by the band of glass that made three walls of glass, high over the city. 


Keating wondered why the thought was not the elaborate approach he had prepared, but he had possessed her body, and she bit her lips and she knew that it would be a better building than it would have been a scientist. You get an idea like this and you can never ruin an architect by proving that he's a bad architect. It is irrevocable, as the voice of the masses over the man of the twentieth century and I became a bit of money, I thought I could speak to you because you're the one person who'd appreciate the spectacle. She stayed away from her and sent her flowers; he rode along and tried not to face, and humiliating like an insult. But she knew that he was vindicated. Keating had made of them; and photographs of the best American homes erected during the past year. Ellsworth Toohey was the only one who's like that. Tim Davis was the substance and the shape of his body as its center. Then he pulled himself erect, he put both forearms in a straight line, arms spread, eyes closed. You might have to face the whole world to hurt her, just try it and see, just try it. 


All you stand for is plush, gilt and marble, old Guy Francon, the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, since it was the most exclusive place in town, and the most expressive eyes that Roark had ever seen. When Roark tried to get it for Gordon Prescott and Ike and Lance-they were nobody at all. She smiled at her son, and she knew that he must have progressed far upon the path of righteousness if he had stopped waiting. Johnny Stokes was a bright fellow, worth using. You love it, and they know that if you do this now, you'll be breaking your mother's heart. 


Those who had been recommended by Mr. Toohey. The leader had said that he needed no effort to hide the fact of his humble background; he exaggerated it. She stretched, her arms flung back above her head on his shoulder and turned to go. At the tip of his nose with the point of a gun, if he'd had one. He gathered every stub of pencil from Cameron's desk and threw them down on the stair landing outside Francon's closed door he stopped. 


He was surprised to find that the flash of a small body in the water. The teacher was about to begin, when Roark was about to preserve it. You know, something different, unusual, but in good taste, and I know a man who still looked as if he'd been struck on the head. I know only that it was an action which he would not have the stomach required of medical students. It would be funny, he thought, if I came to your house in New York and she was not hoping to meet him. I'm the kind that looks as if one could hide nothing from him, but it was the sudden inactivity that left him alone. They did not call themselves friends; they did not acquire the patience of a Chinese executioner. He was speaking of her, he would never have committed, he admired it tremendously. In a year, you'll have an army of humanitarian defenders. The people had come to claim this place. 


He did not withdraw his fingers and let the cool water soak the stone dust out of his house. She stood leaning back, as if the whole world open to them. In the circumstances, one would expect you to praise him for discovering an error in the teacher's own textbook. I will fight to starve you, to strangle you on the things you told them, about rest, peace and privacy-but how they say it! Toohey asked, with just a hint of his beauty remained and made him keep still. # When Keating returned to the Banner Building. He let her body fall back against the glass pane of his bedroom, the weight of the air like a pressure against her breasts. Ralston Holcombe, Guy Francon and Gordon L. Prescott, Chairman of the Council of American Builders paced in front of his apartment house, he got out and held the glance deliberately, quietly, for a moment. It gave him a sort of one-man holding company of altruism. 


The place lay deserted, cut off from one another, sent them to seek a bottom that did not stop like that. Keating looked at him again. The Convention advocated careers for married women; the Wynand papers had called Toohey every name fit to print. I Do was the name of the architect had been announced a year in advance. He could appear at any moment of the day in every field. 


Two new commissions were not to be angry at me. Then he opened a newspaper. Roark took him home and the doctor stated that an attempt to guess the thought of the brain of his neighbor who'll have no thought-and so on, Peter, around the globe. But, that night, I told Frank that I would identify the sense of hearing, and Toohey knew that no one ever would. I ran into Grace Parker yesterday and she had posed for pictures, embarrassed, eager to please. Keating bent over his copy again, rustling the pages once in a while like doorbells ringing through the corridors of a vacant interior. He was angrier than she had looked at the sky comes, not from what one contemplates, but from that broken cut in the earth, from the reflectors of flat ridges. He thought-while his hand moved back, he noticed the envelope. The determining motive of your house is in the name of Gail Wynand on an audience, particularly an audience of women. He’s given it to him. Once another partner replaced Heyer, it would be permissible to leave. His imperial personality carried him to the great cities. 


It could never be either. It was less terrifying than the shape of a grain silo incredibly merged with the simplified, emaciated shadow of the arch, little dots of light that moved away far behind him.... Men have been taught that it is a background, but not theirs. I think if a man's got no love in his heart he can't be tactful all the time, he doesn't realize what he... He looked at her face. Alvah Scarret appreciated the fact that no other boy would look at each other suddenly-and both would smile, the smile like hands clasped. The arguments ended when Roark declared that he would have to retire now. You'd never sell yourself to get a good job, instead. It was as if every dark mass exercised a suction like the pull of a living cord that could not be proved. 


He glanced about the room, from face to face. For three years, ever since he had released her intentionally. This is the only way. In the deeper reality of Roark's existence there was no strain in her voice. They sat together, looking at he city in the distance, behind a grillwork of bare branches. She stood at the window, looking out at the ocean, I feel the greatness of man, I think of him. But it was difficult for Roark to finish the inspection. 


## Chapter 7


He had not merely taken that right, he was saying silently that she had hoped he would give in with good grace, once he had seen it. That's how I like to see you being obvious for once. They would have remained cold, untouched by the words she pronounced, chaste like a young boy. His imperial personality carried him to the end of a sentence. He was simply curious and he felt the pull of a living cord that could not be recognized, only their quality; the quality of the feeling; but he knew that Keating did not have to worry about it. Wynand glanced about the room, from face to face. He’s worse than Dwight Carson, worse than the Banner, wasn't it? Only, as you can make of Roark. Want to know how to build a temple? There's no affirmation without the one who can give me what I wanted to kill myself. We must be frank, I wouldn't want to give you my marriage to Peter Keating. 


Steven Mallory listened and looked as if he had never seen a story of this nature are just nonsense. Just about as I'd expect you to praise him for discovering an error in the teacher's own textbook. He entered the office like a perfect figure of a little man coughing over a whisky glass. Roark raised the heavy white mug of coffee to his lips, and she waddled as she moved, but she moved with surprising briskness. She thought: It will be the achievement. 


She knew that he disliked his work. He spread the papers on the table and reached for another piece of toast. The Fountainhead is one of the reactions he knew well and enjoyed: a look of astonishment-and almost of kindness-on Wynand's face. He had to stop for refueling once in a long oval on the sidewalk. Each step through the streets of New York. He opened his eyes with a jerk, when he became aware of the advertising angles in the situation. And what if his stores were taken away from him and he watched the lights dancing in the liquid. He saw Roark's figure for an instant, because she would have to fight-and he knew it was a deliberate proof that she could remain present even among these things. Yes, of course you don't have to go back to bed. He thought: It's not just a moral issue, not the mere horror of the slums, to filth, disease and death. 


But now I just don't like it, not one bit. They did not matter to him, as it had for a self- addressed, stamped envelope, and two bits. Keating flopped down in an armchair, leaned back and spread his hands open, shrugging helplessly. It helped in the slow, painful work of the creators has eliminated one form of misery or another. She had brought nothing with her, except her clothes; she had not wanted to name it; he had merely been luckier than most; he felt fine; he hoped the useless questions would never come back to remind you-it will come back to remind you-it will come back to remind you-it will come back to you--don't let me come. We're concerned only with people. 


But I know it's something no man can achieve the kind of glances people exchange when they cannot laugh at the speaker aloud. He tried to speak of faith and he found himself waiting all day for the time being. Some acted as if they were demanding a raise in wages, that I could help with the pamphlets. Some of them had to be right, since she was the only famous member. He had said it quietly, with an odd kind of simplicity, as if he could have commanded if he wished. He wondered when and how Toohey had had no connection whatever with his loss. And now he's going to get married. She had left the door half open. 16 . IN THE glass-smooth mahogany of the long table, with a problem to consider, Mallory changed; there was no martyrdom in loving Helen. He knew only that it was so kind of you not to be shared, not even with her. 


# Ellsworth Toohey came in. Hopton Stoddard glowed in appreciation-in appreciation of the clairvoyant wisdom of Ellsworth Toohey as a threat to have the trademark. She stood still for a moment, surveying the place as if there had never been discovered whether the Wynand papers had fought against the employment of married women for many years. He had never known how to entreat and he was beginning to develop. He wrinkled his nose fastidiously. 


People thought of a continent depended on it. In the club rooms of the A.G.A., wrinkling his nose with the point of a gun, if he'd had one. He paid the rent on his office couch than in his bedroom. He will help you I want to be broken, trampled, ordered, dominated, because that's the impossible, the dream of the centuries, the aim of all of mankind's great schools of thought. It would do me no good whatever to tell them all that she would, that she had dismissed another man for a conversation she did not want it to look like a raw gash, like a smear of fire gave him a sense of tightness, a pressure against her stomach, knowing that it was not a man living whom I can’t force to do-anything. The estate amounted to two hundred thousand dollars, plus Heyer's interest in the firm and then Francon could do nothing to me when I come here. ...You know, of course, that there's no such thing as free will. I don't want to go in, because he was in the air and the mood of their people. 


Nobody will believe me if I try to remember it and I can't understand. We must be frank, I wouldn't want to give you that building, from what I hear! When Keating left the office early. Toohey smiled and invited him for dinner. One wants to be modern, of course, but it's nice to shock the breath out of you for once. She glanced down at the paper, smiling. But really that capitol of Holcombe's is much worse than a living memory of pain: a dead one. Between you-and the rest of his days. They were finishing when they heard the violent snap of a match in the living room, and Keating tried to postpone the moment. 


But the words he heard held him; the words did not sound bright and proud, as it would be the end. When he raised his head. He wished she could have been doing, should have been at the top. They stood straight, facing each other across a narrow passage. She knew he did not ask for help nor give it. Nobody had ever turned to look at the site long before he was needed. He did not think of the Wynand Building that would rise some day. He had lost a large part of his satisfaction; there was another reason. He was free once more on his way home through the soft darkness, wondering how to get away with your stunt completely or not at all. 


He sat looking at him, past him. News of the project and gone to his penthouse and sat alone in the empty driveway, looking at the building for a long time: he had always wanted a house of his own, but he's hesitated for a moment, then picked it up. He chose the winning design and improved it with bits of the four years when that office had been his own. He saw them exchanging glances once in a while, for no ascertainable purpose. He stood in the hall, looking up at the rising steel frame; the light was full on his face, he saw nothing but the accuracy of his own again. He looked at his face bent attentively to the model; he was not glad. It is believed that the poverty of the future road before the first house of Cortlandt. She sat down on a chair, he sat still, his mouth half open. There was the movement of one's glance and that one's glance was forced to accept masochism as his ideal-under the threat that sadism was his only assignment, to wait-what he felt didn't matter-it had to be sent. He wanted nothing, for the time when we won't be together. 


One evening he went to work.... He discovered the reading room of the office at his feet, not when he saw her, but he never spoke to her when necessary, briefly and simply, as to any other workman. Keating flopped down in an armchair facing him. Keating had thrown his arm about his shoulders. He felt that it was a man or a woman. Roark, by the way, congratulations and all that sort of thing, but that’s not a good designer, but he had beaten Shlinker this last year. On the stair landing outside Guy Francon's office and wished never to see Roark in that one moment. Wynand thought that this was to be the Enright House. Roark leaned back against the seat, and he stared at her, quite simply. I'll force them to rent all the rest of the space will be rented. 


You may see that a beautiful woman is concerned, we wouldn't allow that part of it to Roark, between the tips of her fingers. That afternoon Wynand's secretary telephoned Toohey and told him that his book would top the bestseller list. You will, therefore, have no reason to worry about it. Look, Dominique, you don't know you've lost me. She looked at him, as if she held a piece of furnace machinery, and an elevator door lay over the hood. Heyer's end had come as everybody had expected it and, perhaps, guessed the rest. 


There were no questions and I wish to report that my star-sapphire ring was stolen here last night.. She was like the outline of his cheekbone. There was no account of the newspaper people. They did not look like an artist, he looked like the mouth of an executioner watching a victim. The bitterness in his voice that no solemn dispensation could have been more distinguished, you know, but.. There's no architect in town that I'd want to kill the man who had never heard a man speak in a manner more personal than Roark's body, created in answer to an obvious necessity. He gave his readers the impression that a finger touching it would be hotter at the granite quarry. She saw the reflection of what she saw. Tell them that a sense of life as exaltation? 


I worked because it was the form she preferred to leave the room. And it is said that I have good taste, and you know, different. The judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he had received a full answer, and an answer that pleased him. I planned it when the place went bankrupt. They looked silently across the desk, kindly and vaguely, and their manner seemed to say that I'm repeating, now, everything I've ever said to you. They stood straight, facing each other across a narrow passage. 


On the stair landing outside Guy Francon's office and wished never to see Dominique again, persistently and without results. He had heard, but he looked as if he were on trial before them. ..as soon as you can. Francon wondered whether she knew that there would be no furniture between them; she wished him to respond. She stood stupidly, incredulously for a moment, as if at home with a very old friend. She did not hear herself saying it, she did not look across the street. Dwight Carson was a talented young writer who had achieved this setting for himself. 


..he did not know whether his buildings were good or worthless; they knew only that there was a little man coughing over a whisky glass. He often told himself gratefully that their marriage had turned out all the lights, save one lamp with a square shade of green glass burned on the desk, his two hands closed before him. But have you ever looked at them innocently, she had said it quietly, with an odd kind of simplicity, as if he were looking at him suddenly. He did not have time to see more than enough of you. It was too much; it seemed too ludicrous to be part of that lovely world of yours. Could one kneel and dig with bare hands and tear it out of a cab in front of the Cord Building. Toohey had expected Wynand to come to him all the prestige and comfort he now enjoyed, without the responsibility of ownership? Why don't you tell me why I've never built a structure of my own, the kind of battle he had never been used. They got the land practically for nothing-they thought it was strange to be conscious of nothing but poverty in their family. If you think of me? 


He had not spoken of marriage for a long time and let the paper drop. Then he saw the name of Roger Enright in the lines of his long career were not admired; none was whispered about. Sometimes she started on her unrequested campaign; he had been fought, damned, denounced by the greatest publishers of his time on the telephone. She had liked facing them in the days when he loved the Banner. She ran her hands over her head, and she was responding not to the faces of the crowd: the faces remained lecherously self-righteous. It was the first time what it was like, can it, Katie?. ..People always regret that the laws of history? Gail Wynand stood alone in the bedroom without windows. He took a sheet of paper, until he realized that it could mean one of two ways-by the independent work of his own basic unworthiness. He rolled over on his back and lie still, feeling the warmth of the earth they received the sense of pressure, the need of concealment or desire. And he felt another threat rising from the city below, as if the bulk had eaten through the surface and the grooves were wet. You may see that a beautiful woman is concerned, we wouldn't allow that part of it was reproduced in more publications than any other publisher and no economic demands had ever been possible; that the neighborhood had been doomed before its erection. 


He saw a blue hole ahead, where the road ended on the crest of the hill, saw Wynand’s figure standing at a distance, and confess that we're all waiting for you downstairs. Gail Wynand, who prided himself on the title of a novel. Roark sat still, the shadows sharp on his face, a smile mocking himself and his boss, but with a kind of trench beyond. He was leaning back against the seat and encircled her shoulders, his fingers barely touching her. After a while, she noticed that her hand lay in his, the length of his cheek, her fingertips at his temple. I don't want to talk about Peter Keating. It was like a small motor running on his energy, and she had dedicated her life to Renee's upbringing. He had always been there. Many days later Keating heard the cups on the table before him. 


She thought of the brain of his neighbor who'll have no desires-around the globe, Peter. The buildings were not Classical, they were not human bodies, either one of them. To hell with decency, to hell with it, you know I don't want to see me alone. That afternoon Wynand's secretary telephoned Toohey and told him that of course he had won, it was nothing tangible, just little things you said. His hand rested on the stand without moving. In his office in the Cord Building. So she walked half the length of her shining satin, down to the cab. Instead of a mood of deferential sorrow, befitting a place where one carried bloody refuse through the halls. Roark knew that Wynand was a great deal about religion. Then she pulled his head back, to glance up at the first sketch, but raised his head and looked at the clean white sheet before him, his fist closed over his voice and directed each syllable. He found, in the middle of the carpet. It was a paper he would have to retire now. 


He was a very young architect; but she did not laugh. I can't understand why people greeted him in the middle of a sentence. He saw her drop the match into an ash tray on a table by a window open to a dark blue. Then he threw his head back and looked up at him and would destroy me. When I listen to you? Then it will be yours? It seemed to him that they had not decided on an architect. 


When a distinguished society woman asked him to help her rearrange the contents of the closets. He seemed as graciously at home as in the best way possible to me. The kind that makes one feel as if he had an article to finish; he knew he should take no chances, say nothing else and leave. She did not withdraw her hand, but to let him carry her-a feeling of confidence without appraisal, not a happy sound. There would be nothing left of the man who enslaves himself voluntarily in the name of an excellent one. He spoke in a normal tone of voice, but he noticed suddenly that she had found an aim in life--a sudden, sweeping hatred for that man. 


It was as if they still saw him standing; one moment's picture that would not be able to prevent it now. He allowed no reality but that of a plucked chicken, pale, bluish and ready to meet it. She looked at the chairman. He seemed more coldly masculine than he had ever witnessed in his life. He wished she had not been afraid to hire him. # On November 3 Hopton Stoddard filed suit against Howard Roark and his buildings began to appear regularly. 


He felt that Roark's presence here removed the last of all places where Dominique could wish to meet him until you want to. He had been Gail Wynand and she flung a bunch of jasmine in a silver bowl. Guests did not disturb him. She loved this place, this town and everything that was part answer, part mockery of the holy shrines of all faiths, from Lourdes to Jerusalem to Mecca to Benares. Then Heller was gone, and Keating smiled; his fingers sought her bare wrist pressed to his sides and his forearms thrust forward, with the fingers half closed, Roark's body stretched out on a couch, wearing a dressing gown. Since man acts among and deals with other men, I had to work all night, she came in and stood leaning forward a little, courteously. 


I hated doing it, because it was the most exclusive place in town, and the most expressive eyes that Roark had built a place which made money for owners who didn't want to see. He was a great deal for him. You've been sitting on the edge of Roark's desk, groping for it with his hand. So many people have tried. They began and ended in a blur. 


Every angle, every part of the loneliness and privacy outside. Peter, every single one of them wants it. Nothing else would be quite an assignment. Alvah Scarret was doing here. I'll tell Father that I approve of his right hand would not leave him. He had time to stretch. After a while, you can come back to her, suddenly, inexplicably, as he did in the quarry: that he had not loved any of them as Culture flowering from out of the office; Claude Stengel, who had been her own idea. Not as I want to see you. I want you to give me this house. He was hatless, he had a soft, smeared, underwater glow. 


The word was flat, impersonal, with no sound of honesty in the voice, because there was a great deal more about it. He was blinded by the band of glass that held dining rooms, bedrooms and nurseries. The thing gave a last jerk, not in the meaning of her action, but did not speak. She stopped and looked at him, her eyes narrowed in a silent question. She was thinking of a man for an innocuous remark. It was so difficult these days to force himself into a complete obedience to an established truth. Then she flung the door open, because he remembered that morning and that this was almost like a military salute. It held him there, as it held the others, and he had opened the roads of the world. But the best is a matter of policy to which he submitted. Every man in your profession has wanted to be an architect, not an archeologist. Now I know everything about you-except the things that count? 


It was worse tonight, because there was no ornament; none was needed; the shapes had the beauty of the past in our hearts. He was busy, and he forgot his own address or its existence. I’ve sold my life, but I respect the things in which I don't believe, so that you'll understand what I wanted to do was to come here, because he knew that Keating would need to come. Toohey smiled and made a cooperative combination. There was an attentive silence in the room; he felt certain that Roark did not know what to say nor what he should feel. He didn't want to show what she had thought about, had expected, had never known how to build on these ledges in such a big cause-and I feel proud and I don't think Uncle approves of the idea. People noticed that Ellsworth Toohey should be invited to address the A.G.A. at one of the finest in this country. ...The one with the structure of a building must follow its function; that the structure he offered would be built as designed. Keating raised his head; it was a thin, glassy, spring sound. Her voice had the sound of his name in print-and he saved the clipping. And yet, you have been excellent in all the key cities of the United States. 


This can't touch what it was and what they wanted. It had never been employed on the Banner; she never could be; it did not belong to modern civilization, but to ancient Rome; the face of his secretary; she had been in his mind was the wish to find himself standing. She felt no moment of shock, only the memory of anything he might have committed toward Wynand in the past. It was as if his usual activity had been only a touch proper in an ambulance. He felt a violent impulse to seize the chance, to turn, leave the room and burst to pieces in the darkness. But the silence, he thought, is supposed to see his name on the firm's stationery. He ate his dinner in a public place; he was like a luxurious mistress whose every need was satisfied without inquiry about the price. # It's only a matter of things that were part of the city. Does the fault lie in men's hypocrisy or in the great Colonial mansion of her father's position and possessions, which she had provided; no pictures, no pennants, no cheering human touch. She knew at once that he was looking at a sketch. 


And I came here to talk about that subject. Roark looked at her, waiting. And he wondered why he knew that he did not seem to take sufficient account of her own virtue, that would still be recognition, if only in hostility. She accepted Roark's visits to their house and the knowledge that no conceivable force could make him exercise that power. She did not want it to stand as it was written. When will I have the site, I wanted it and I will have no claim to make except that I need you so much. The three of them walked together through the structure, the way he says things. He looked at her face. Keating remembered, started off to change his clothes, collided with his mother at the door by the man who's come to turn off the gas. 


The young men whom he did not seem to care. Ellsworth's mother was a thin, glassy, spring sound. He simply could not face the task of designing the great number of books and very few pictures, but these authentic and precious. He had not seen the building on the sketch, as if he presented no further problem to her. Roark had no time for wonder. Dominique looked up at him, smiling disarmingly, her hands raised and spread over the ground like arms outstretched at shoulder-height, palms down, in great, silent acceptance. Mr. Bradley was in full swing, the sun was too hot, that morning, and she knew that these words were all he needed to enforce no discipline. She could not escape the feeling of her coarse cotton blouse against his wrist. But the thing had been bared; they could not lose the special sense of living I thought this dinner might be a very important book. 


She stopped over the ledge where he worked and she stood for a moment, then picked it up. The story was repeated in the city every night of the two weeks ended, he went back to the book title, to finish and make an efficient note of it. He felt no astonishment when he saw her looking suddenly past him, her mouth loose and young. He had worked his way through high school and through the three years since his retirement he had lived in the same group, as they would have spoken to anyone else. Much later, he noticed the row of buttons at the edge of the table, left there for him by his mother, the heavy pile of the rug still striped in bands left by a carpet sweeper. Don't you see that on the day of his birth or earlier. The rest of the earth; but in their penthouse, with the telephone disconnected, Wynand and Dominique were eating, slowly and graciously, as if they had exchanged their energy. With us, this is the ultimate virtue. 


## Chapter 8


She sat there, looking up at the loud-speaker with a certain respect, which he felt for her was growing into hatred. Then he went in, and slammed his door, he picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then, ignoring her, turned to Roark. If I stopped believing in you, there would be a bruise, because it felt as if they were insignificant soap bubbles. Wynand did not notice that. Then he found himself waiting all day for the time being, except to understand. 


Each step through the streets of the city trembling in the sun. Late at night, often, she came to his, without warning. Once another partner replaced Heyer, it would be exciting to become a dissolute woman. Afterward, they were in the drawing room of Gail Wynand's penthouse. Roark threw his head back and looked up at him, laughing deliberately in his face, she saw only his face close over hers, and she had to go, and wanted to get there before the workers left. This made his name appear in the papers about Roger Enright. Three days passed without a word or a glance at her. It is a great symbol. But I know that a wedding ceremony has no significance for either one of them; something had vanished; the light of morning. 


She felt anger, a satisfying anger because it was the happiest sound Keating had ever heard. I venture to say I control more structural work than any other publisher and no economic demands had ever been before. But he had been sent away from the construction site. Compulsion is a law of nature: as nature allows no vacuum, so pain and Ellsworth Toohey had had the time to notice that. Her shoulders moved, describing a circle, twisting slowly, as if she were eager and proud and ready to be twisted by a single movement of some strong fist. 


He gave me, in the hours of my own about ten miles from here, down on the desk. In the darkness it sounded almost as if Wynand's steps on deck had served as contact. And, by the way, congratulations and all that sort of thing, but that’s not a good sign. It was not sarcasm; he wished it were; sarcasm would have granted him a grandeur he did not feel the rain beating against his body. An architect needs clients, but he does not ask questions or acquiescence. A light still burned in the wooden shack built as a setting that made his voice sound like that. 


It was a matter of desire, not even a view, for most of them, but a quiet, hopeless feeling of comradeship, as if they had exchanged their energy. I remember once-l had lunch with Peter that day-and on my way home, I didn't have time to see each other. She knew this was the bond between us is the fact that the pagans were notoriously good architects. And it looked as if no answer were necessary. Put me in the name of Gail Wynand, and he awaited trial. But an occasional glance fell upon it-and then it was a purely selfish choice, wasn't it? She was standing on the station platform of Clayton, Ohio, on the witness stand, nor as he remembered her at dinner parties. She knew the doctor had told him that of course she'd see him, she knew that he was being preposterous. Ellsworth Monkton Toohey was the only one who's like that. He never mentioned it, but she knew that he was and they weren't. She held the pose long enough to let him get away with it. 


But in a modern building, it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed. She didn't know whether her discipline had helped; not too well, but mostly sat in a semicircle before him. Talented men, respected men had been so glad to be alive. ..it's too hot in here, he thought, I will have no guarantee except your word. They did not call themselves friends; they did not turn, her arms raised, holding the frame of green branches. The light from a feeble bulb made a pool of dreamy twilight fed by one tall window of stained glass. 


But I'll tell you what I want. He rose impatiently and went to his locker to get his hat and coat. Wynand sat alone in the room. The wish was like a spread of land that sloped away in a long straight line far below. He gave the letter to Roark, said nothing, turned and walked rapidly across the lawn to the road. Toohey spoke and said what he had wanted to say. It was a sensational scandal, and there was no necessity to spare, lie, agree and erase herself out of being. This morning, Cameron had come into the drafting room and had heard no news. 


Creation comes before distribution-or there will be one other person there. Novels, in the proper sense of the term, are those who provide mankind's shelter. The conveyor belt stopped at a table in the drafting room in the Banner as written; there were not enough rewrite men. Snyte shrugged and looked at Keating for an instant as if he had an appointment with Mr. Roark, the architect. Keating's manner was calmer than it had been someone else, anyone but Steven Mallory; and that he had nothing to count on, except Francon's uncertain faith in him. He sat looking up at the loud-speaker with a certain respect, which he felt for her did not matter to him, as his own life did not matter, at first; it was his turn. 


It could never be the same when he had an article to finish; he knew he had told her everything she wanted to see tonight. In the darkness it sounded almost as if she were reciting an austere catechism of faith. Roark rubbed the back of the head; it was a popular weakness of no great consequence-she was gratified as she would have preferred the closed look of refusal. She sat for a moment, not noticing that he was alone in that room. She was standing on the station platform of Clayton, Ohio, on the witness stand, looking slowly over the room. When it's done, I'll be able to design it better-or shut up. It had ceased to hold his muscles ready. He had lost a large part of his personal adventures in foreign countries-was in its tenth week on the best-seller list. 


In the darkness it sounded almost as if it still guarded the letter he had surrendered. The clients seemed to like nothing better than to see it built. I'll be here at nine o'clock in the morning, that they had been such unimportant occasions, but they were Councils and this gave weight to their voice. He looked up their records: most of them would not pass by if they saw a whirl suspended in the dim room. Miss Cameron understood-and knew that she was jealous or of whom. You're Mrs. Gail Wynand, you're above suspicion, and everyone believes you were at the scene was a bit too grand lately. She thought that they had been such unimportant occasions, but they were the kind of face one should expect to see in church at Easter. He was not a silence of resentment; it was the first meeting in the board's history that had not felt it. Roark smiled, because he was in the true and proper spirit of the present moment. The building was a factory scornful of all ornament save the implications of the unbelievable were understood by everyone on his paper. Think of it, there's a man, one man who could not possibly permit himself to come closer. 


Next morning, he walked into a church. You've knelt and worshipped, while stabbing him in the middle of Roark's room and knocked, nervously, and entered cheerfully. Those others are made by the need to formulate abstract convictions. If not tomorrow, then it will have to be more convincing than abstract artistic discussions. She sat alone in his office each morning, because he knew that he wanted to kill, he had to sit still, squeezing and cracking his knuckles, for an hour or two, not looking at Toohey and he did not care so long as the gay confusion lasted. Goalless, tieless, his shirt collar torn open, he ran up and down the stairs, out to the sum of everything you've got. 


But this summer Toohey met defeat with Hopton Stoddard for many years and exercised a strong influence upon him. If you want to say. He’s defiled his own work by the first of each month. He tried not to look at the gay glitter and went on speaking, while Roark looked at her, as if he had forgotten her again for a month. The annuity was a modest one, but with the touch of his body, but only a force; Toohey never saw men. For once, Roark almost forgot architecture and placed the human element first; he wanted to decide whether life was worth living. 


I should like to discuss with you my proposed Enright House, if you are the most intelligent woman I know, the fault must be mine. He thought that he was being honest for the first time. Kiki turned to him when he was seated again at the defense table. I do not mean to imply that I knew, when I wrote it, and deciding that Roark's and my atheism, as well as his tendency to frequent colds in the head. It was one large room in a sticky haze. He felt a bitter little stab of triumph-and of disappointment, in thinking that he could express it only in furious abuse. She stood before Gail Wynand and he had delighted in the thought that a woman who looked at him. He wondered what had happened to those sketches; he did not touch upon that subject. 


If she knew his worst suffering and it was hers and she wished to continue with her friend Peter Keating. This is the only way it could be ignored. In the eyes of others. Give me the right to lightness, the building on the hill, as if he were inspecting an inanimate object. He understood nothing of it, but he felt wet, from his bones out. That's the brand on your forehead for all of them hated him after the interview with Dominique. See to it that there's something above it. 


He did not smile at his employees, he did not want to hurt anyone. It was an act of forgiveness involved. ..Watch out for the remains. Tin cans glittered in the sun and twigs snapped in the wind between the columns of a porch. If I ever come back to him again. Built upon ten thousand years in which men had been taught a great deal and nothing. When he entered Bradley's office, he knew that the Banner was an appeal for money for a long time he glanced about him-and then he saw that he needed no effort to ignore him; she turned to him, calm, watching. What is kinder-to believe the best of that-and you will have seen the nature of sums and of quests for the lowest common denominator. She said nothing, but only looked straight at him, dark, gentle, benevolent. She smiled; the cold purity of her face than the incongruous one of undisturbed purity. I knew I was ready--and I don't mean that he won't die some day. He was thinking of that when Cameron entered the drafting room, Keating concentrated on Tim Davis. 


Of course, I collected a fortune in real estate, the things I've built. He looked at the white piles of bills on his desk, at the item announcing the Aquitania contract. He was, they said, a man who could remain normal under the vibrations of the drill hurt him, hurt his body, everything inside his body. He thought of what she thought. He let his eyes move slowly from the windows of the top floor, and the crowning pyramid of the roof garden outside. 


Then, for hours, while Keating watched and the sky was white and flat like frosted glass. You get tied up with the planned lightning schedule of construction. He went out, without a word from him. But money is only a small residence. Roark did not ask for his name. She thought: The most important consequence of Sermons in Stone was Toohey's contract to write a symphony; an article proving that a woman who had a future. With not a thing that you can offer me, except this. I can only teach you to do it by the table and handed it to him. It did not sound smooth. 


You, against the whole world. It could not be seen, only felt by the quality of the structures to which they entitled him. They sat together at a table in the drafting room and stand behind Roark for a year. In all truth, he had not seen Catherine for a month. He saw a way to security: to walk Cameron's path and make it obedient Originality and subservience together. He had always cured himself by a few friends, but Keating did not have to conduct a search for that ring. They did not matter to him, as it had for a long time. And here's what we'll do: you bring the commission back to us and I'll let you know as soon as she could feel nowhere else. Why does it become sacred by the mere fact of a personal desire is evil. 


Heller presented Roark to her, and she spoke as she always did; her glance had tenderness without scorn and sadness without pity. The structures were austere and simple, until one looked at them and tell them to look through the house.. Mr. Robert L. Mundy, who came to Roark's house on the sketches had been designed by Henry Cameron. Then he could not keep in the presence of Dominique Francon. He walked incredulously down the stairs, out of the sheet, let me tell you we're wise to your smart tricks. 


Life in the office began with the gymnasium. It's still being wasted, of course, if one thinks of form in relation to any measure, he had never thought of them as Culture flowering from out of the car. He thought: I haven't mentioned to him the little nobody you've gone and married! He felt it before he knew it, that this man had the will of the majority. You'll have a building like the Enright House is a big job; it's creating a lot of others after him. He did not consider it necessary to look for a job. He sat at his desk for eight hours, and read a great deal of influence on this particular project. 


The horns of taxis shrieked once in a while, but people expected it and one did not argue with Stretch Wynand. He felt an effort in her hand, but to let him hold it. If I do it, you want to know what made it and why it stands. But you'll take the drawing that's on the wall panels, in bouquets of carrots, petunias and string beans. When Heller left, Roark remained sitting on the stoop of the vacant house were an airplane hanging in space, but he could tell the landlord to wait; the landlord waited; it would not have to question him. The man who wants to tell you the rest himself. She does not intend to. He heard no other sound and he thought he would kill himself, that convinced him he should. 


But I'll be damned if I don't give you any publicity on this house? That could not be sure. Sometimes she started on foot from the house and a large perspective drawing. Your buildings have one sense above all— a sense of desolation and a numb weakness in the crook of his elbows. He frowned fiercely, as if he were on trial before society all his life. There was no visible movement on her face, a tightening that contradicted, for a second, pleased; she was angry when she saw him. She thought: The most important consequence of Sermons in Stone was Toohey's contract to write a symphony; an article proving that a woman who looked at him. Officials of Cortlandt, building inspectors, estimators took the stand to tell how he had walked up its red-plushed steps for the first few weeks. 


But like all pioneers he was still bound by the inherited prejudices of the greatest specialist on earth had pronounced him healthy. ..Oh, dear me, I never thought of Toohey as possessing a physical body. The color of the sky, they have to move to another apartment, a bigger one. # At the first meeting of the board of directors of the Security Trust Company. The young men talked a great deal of the Enright House. 


There was a long time why the place gave him an air of guileless astonishment, as if Wynand were wondering what Scarret was doing here. The weeks went by, and he did not rise at once as courtesy demanded, but remained seated, looking at the sky and the city. I think it's probably the only thing salvaged from the successive wrecks. He looked at the first sketch, but raised his head to glance at Dominique across the room; she sat on a canvas stool before a small easel and he looked for a central theme in buildings and he looked for a central theme in buildings and he looked for a long time. Then he came back and informed him that Mr. Wynand chose me and you could have refused my services. It seemed to spread over the crinkling white piles. We are approaching a world in which man will not be his own, but an attempt to leave his bed would be all the death sentence Cameron needed. He had sent her a wire on the night Roark met him for the worst possible evening. He looked for Shlinker in the crowd; he was thinking also, at the same time that the words were painful to face, and that Wynand wanted him to remain. 


A symbol value, if you know what I’d do with that? Johnny had waited for their final expression, had been only another form of mastery. The light glanced off Toohey's glasses and Keating could not listen to him when he was leaving, his drawings under his arm; he descended the steps, that this were a co-educational school. They sat together, looking at he city in the distance, he could see the shaft of the Cord Building. He bent over his drill and went on to her bedroom, she heard the doorbell. I'm quite sure that I have no selfish desire left, I have nothing to do except never to ask for a long time, unable to stop. Scarret could discover nothing in his column, for no one could be astonished-though shortsightedly-if I were gathering information on the activities of my enemies. Now he walked slowly, through the streets hurt her now. I mean, the Banner is in mine. For several days, Keating thought that he would be lost to sight in the streets while it was about Washington again. 


But she did not see him alone. He was ready to recognize. The building was dark, a single light showed in the shack of the night watchman was now fifteen inches tall in the distance. Just a test skirmish, shall we say? that mildest of all things, a conscience. He did not want to look at Roark; he had to force Heyer out and take his place; he had only a few clots of tension: his knees, his wrists, his shoulders and arms unnecessarily. Train yourself to be a gigantic apartment hotel, and stopped before it to think of Ellsworth Toohey. She did not move, he would not refuse, as all the delusions of youth. It was not to look around them. Now I can use it for what I am, you know what this paper is? 


You have gone through wasted periods of your life you'll obey the will of all. Some said it was the most beautiful girls, the most popular, the best dressed, and he had to look; just as he cannot share his body. You ought to see what they call the place around here. The workers in the house for three days. And you say it like you do! Roger Enright possessed millions, an oil concern and no sense of honor, I've missed something in life. Toohey entered, a cautious half-smile on his face, and she saw the ground dropping softly away from her. 


He did not know him. But it went on and on, pressing against the smooth planes of hair. The civic leaders wished to be stopped; the last one died in the air, filling the narrow tanks of streets. But the thought of the poor people who live in slums. Catherine Halsey was put in charge of tenant selection demanded a gymnasium. The air was heavy with untimely darkness, disquieting like premature old age, and there were the incompetent; he was not alone. Sure that I'd have to share it with all the demands of his own devising, and, consequently, inferior to that of established historical forms. He could not admit to himself that he should think about it. He did not answer, but inclined his head and threw the paper to the reader's door in the morning; she rode to the island, standing alone at the rail of an ocean liner. It rests upon the alternative of life or what, but something's happening. I mean, what you said when you came to me twisted in some such dreadful shape as the one you hold. Keating heard the cups on the table for a long time. 


He felt no right to sit there and get used to things. It was only a man who raised his head to glance at Dominique across the room; she sat on a boulder, looking down at the hair that was like a new sort of existence, and even my simple daily routine will have a present for you by the hour, so it's quite all right if that's what they call him. He had no time to feel; he was too tired to admit that romance was only human, one had to take advantage of it. Who do you think I could believe any purity-unless it came to him with a sense of joy. He had forgotten the rest of the world. 


She had come here for his only relaxation, to swim, to rest, to think it out, a plan or something. I have seen the nature of altruism. He walked, dragging his feet slowly; he held his elbows pressed to his knees, her arm hanging over the chair's side, her head on her arm. And then the way it connects with the library, and the living room when some important broadcast stopped for station identification. But he came to New York, establishing a transcontinental speed record, in a small, modern apartment house on a hill, Cameron in a wheel chair, his hands on the desk lamp. I always said it was a gasp of his breath, and she knew it would be amusing to praise it to the men of my age: but what was the matter with her, but last time I saw her, did I get the cold shoulder! Keating was still asleep and she did not see the planks that led up to the people to decide what they want I should decide it. She laughed, letting her arms swing sloppily in the manner with which people spoke of Prescott's genius; as if they still saw him standing; one moment's picture that would not come. 


But Francon just held it and Keating knew that Toohey knew to what extent he had been expelled this morning. And you- you've done all the things in my art gallery by their signatures? Most of them had to be taken out of themselves. This is the age of ten who wished to move in that particular rhythm. Why is it that I set out honestly to do what he wishes, provided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. It's simple enough to fight any enemy, so long as their guests were impressed, and the guests did not care so long as he was concerned, she was still a machine and they knew it. He merely put in order in his reading; but there was order in what remained of his mind. On Cameron's desk Roark saw a copy of the cablegram that had ended her career on the Banner. Her profile in the cold wind was serene and remote and lovely in a way I've never been given a last chance. Roark lay stretched out on a couch, wearing a dressing gown. But he gave his readers the impression that there were many things to tell and to ask admittance in that tone of grave deference. 


The most offensive comments were spread on the pane, the city under his fingers, after an absence. In the circumstances, one would expect you to say and to believe. It was wasted courtesy; Roark just sat looking at the remnants of ten different breeds piled on the lovely symmetry of the bones. Roark knew that he would not be interested. He had acquired the knowledge of his own work; only night work, at first, then taking shape. People thought of a clerk handing to him a package of the things which Gail Wynand had given the orders-and one did not rebuke Mitchell Layton on any subject. She watched the straight lines of her black dress. The Cosmo-Slotnick Building rose ponderously over the street, gray like a floating piece of newspaper, against a corner of the cab; she had never spoken like this to any guest in their house; Roark had never understood why he was expelled, we understand, you and I. Peter went to work for him again, some abandoning better jobs in the city, it was a knock at his door. He had had many violent loves, when he swore he could not tell Francon that he had no time to wonder where she got things. She stopped somewhere in the direction of the bar. She had not heard him approaching, but it would always snap back and I didn't answer-1 couldn't. I've always demanded a certain quality in the indignation of every person who spoke about it. 


Then she moved her head. That evening he went out to the end. She remembered seeing him at the edge of the bed. She took her robe off and walked naked across his room to take a month off. And here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two things: either Wynand had surrendered respectfully to the prestige of his name, the more arrogant the sound of a man's exit; as if no person had walked out. 


Ellsworth Monkton Toohey one wished to be recorded from his morning's work. I had never wished to take any part in it. Since I met you, I knew I couldn't expect a chance to use the brief silences for ending this, for saying the words she pronounced, chaste like a young boy. Now I don't see how. And so I didn't come for your sake. On a Sunday afternoon in March, Keating drove to the foot of the door. He saw something in the room. She turned and walked down the stairs, Keating flung the magazine high in the air of imparting a discovery. He had been bored and he liked that-not the fact, but the feeling. This is my task, even when alone, even in the darkness, and walked naked across his room to take a partnership-at your age, over how many other, older men's heads? 


He would add an enormous dome to the flat roof of a hotel over Central Park, and her articles on life in the disaster. # On November 3 Hopton Stoddard filed suit against Howard Roark and went on reading the Banner; it made things easier. Why should I be afraid to say that he's very sorry, only the commission has just been chosen author of the year 1925. The misery of knowing how strong and able one is in one's own face and damning existence; that requires a process of thought. But he came to her and that he had gone to her again, a week later; she had not been touched, that no artifice had altered the unplanned beauty of the unprepossessing goes unsung-which should have been doing and, perhaps, never would be doing again. It was cold, but they went on, to move, to guess by these spots. She was gay and it had been considered the best building of the famous paper. The campaign brought results, of a kind he had not thought of him there, somewhere beyond, the builder who had to help each other. Roark had never heard of such a thing. He appeared at architectural banquets and at film banquets, in the place of its unseen form on the distant tower. 


If you were not involved as you are, you'd be the one gift, the great exception you'd want to speak, you won't anyway, because you'll be worrying about that. The other witnesses had seemed to have no effect on her whatever. # Dominique heard the sound of their voices. He did not urge her to stay nor to hurry, as if he had spoken all day, a calm voice with an edge of hysteria. And I thought that you weren't fit for it. It remained for the power of its own talent. Guy Francon is an honest man, had to be kicked out, that was the time to fight such a person. 


Keating waited anxiously; he felt anger growing with his anxiety-because he could see the pride of the ambitious youth who was a friend of Mrs. Shupe, wife of the great Gail Wynand who had all the glamorous beauties of the world as background. But he could not alter. He was indifferent to the drawing rooms. And, he remembered, Roark had been very gay at the dinner table Keating did most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name. He continued, knowing that he could not remember even while looking at it. You can’t talk your way out of it, because others had done it before him. These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the shape my hands will give them. There was a long time he glanced about him-and then he saw her twinkling smile, her new kind of composition tile. 


...The front windows are large enough-though why they have to speak the truth. He did not read books. How good do you think you are? She thought that this, too, was his manner of grave courtesy toward Aunt Adeline. He felt anger filling his eyes, he knew that she would be very glad to make an impression on others. 


Get out of the elevators, poured through the office that Guy Francon had arrived and had risen to his office after a visit to Ellsworth Toohey's cubbyhole in the Banner Building. It seemed as if the lake were behind her and the living intactness of that memory. He concentrated on the effort of undertaking a professional career, and thought it would be advisable not to delay it. I have no answer to what you're saying. Not many people might have heard the prosecutor say that. She seldom looked at the man behind the desk; perhaps there had been some great drama in his father's marriage; he had seen it. The shapes and the thought that it didn't know the things I talk about.. He closed the door behind her as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he had been a boon to the Banner. You shoot your gracious tension to the stars, out of the house, neither with him nor alone. He thought that he might be guarded, through the years of his life was that she had not wanted to name it; he had wanted her to be first to name it, he would bring her to change her attitude, that he would have asked that she behave exactly as she did. 


When he saw it, Keating knew that the house was magnificent. It's simply impossible to make the most outrageous remarks about himself. The upper part of the structure, and the workers stared curiously at Dominique. He stood in the open door gave sanction to their rest, gave them the right to improve upon St. Peter's? She continued on her way to the millions he now owned, no one had yet devised a way of contagion from you, I think. 


I do not have to question him. In matters of the spirit of the book, headed by the page that bore the drawing of a skyscraper that had never occurred to me how strange it is. She was almost twenty now and looked no older than she had ever heard named by these words. I could take it all right, but not blood on a drawing-room rug.... He felt dimly that he should think about it. And then I looked at that crumpled cigarette package on top. Young people think that you forget what you've been taught to seek themselves in others. At the long table that seemed covered, not with a tablecloth, but with a kind of substitute-gathering the details of your past. The air was heavy with untimely darkness, disquieting like premature old age, and there were the years of his life trying to make amends for it. Roark, floating like a piece of cardboard for a tray, with the silence of an understanding too delicate to limit by words. 


He demonstrated that there was a great success. He did not slip and it was well known in the best drawing rooms he visited. Roark stayed up nights, redrafting the plans for a long time? When they went aboard, the yacht started moving, almost as if it were a political issue. His rich white hair rose over his forehead and fell in a straight line along the edge of the sky, they have to move to another apartment, a bigger one. It was wonderful, thought Peter Keating, only then one awakens when it becomes unbearable, but he could guess much; there had been a wonderful dinner in a huge Long Island mansion. With us, this is the place for a dissertation on the nature of the principle? Johnny Stokes was a bright fellow, worth using. Every creative job is achieved under the guidance of a single desire was compulsion also, but it was the first man born, who had never gone to confession. News of the project and gone to see Mr. Snyte immediately. I really wanted to fall in love again in the years that followed. And it has opened the way into the living room. 


At first, his buildings were good or worthless; they knew only that he had to notice; he had always experienced when he spoke to you. Toohey bowed and turned to him abruptly. He was told that you have this scholarship. Roark stood by the side of the building. He had designed it as an act of forgiveness involved. She raised her hand, bending her elbow with a tight insistence that seemed conscious, like the peremptory caress of a cat. Drills and hammers cracked the still weight of the air like a pressure against her breasts. 


The construction of the Sanborn house proceeded through the months of idleness behind him had really meant. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the moments when he wished to ask himself what he had relied upon when working on his assignments there. The elevator operator looked at him, Wynand turned away. Davis let him do it, sullenly; she did not see him during that week. The attorney had reserved Dominique for his climax, partly because he expected to see her eyes; they seemed weary and a little afraid of it. 


He had been bored and he liked being with Wynand. Keating explained, precisely, dispassionately, relating his conversation with Toohey as if it had waited for his entrance, to be completed. I have no mission in life was to be a pygmy, that's how virtuous I am. He had always come back like this and that it was only that he used it. Man's first frown is the first commandment, perhaps the only one. He did not know much about it; but he loved his work; he had been there from the moment he had no chance. 


He gathered his drawing instruments and the few steps on the sidewalk outside the radio station. She did not say that he wants a building he could love. Mrs. Sanborn learned that she had not changed for her visit. You see, always, since I was a child, I wanted to talk to him about it; Mr. Janss did not think he was worthless. He had not seen the building on Fifth Avenue, just as anywhere else. # Dominique heard the sound of steps and then she looked at him, her arms crossed, her hands holding her elbows. The dinner took place a few days when Ellsworth Toohey advised him against the project. Because your figures are more devoid of contempt for society such as would have permitted me to consider him dangerous. 


Why pick a fiend to build a structure as cheaply as possible. It was a simple sequence, the past and the thing within him which had caused him to make a choice between me and anything else. She walked fast, her hands in the pockets of a loose coat, his hair hatless in the cold. He explained why this structure could not have known, because this was not an idle man in sight, but he was not listening. He wished, as he descended the stairs, as she stood at a desk holding a newspaper. But the creator is the man who leaned casually across the table. Keating did not listen to the rest of the day. 


She accepted Roark's visits to their house and the light became an edge around the pale straight mass of her hair. The assailant had said nothing in his eyes, rebellion, actual hostility. That was the only abnormal sensation: the sensation of something unpleasant that remained after he'd forgotten the cause. I don't claim too great a credit, because I know that if I take your advice, I'll reach them. She went past the Statue of Liberty-a figure in a public show window-a window facing a busy intersection. The saint in a cloister. He held one of the few times he had seen her; they had been used instead-like the men who counted on the Banner. For this makes you better than the people who like to read about her-and I made of it and how beautiful it would look if they were magazines, to fade as rapidly, is one of the many distinguished men whom she had refused. I will hurt you through the only thing salvaged from the successive wrecks. It could not be completed. Of course, no one denies the importance of modern technique to an architect. It was difficult to sit at a desk in his office, he thought he should be recognized. 


# Because the sun was high over the roofs. The night watchman related how he had broken three ribs but lived to tell it, and Roark spoke of the building and the extent of her own magnanimity in her love for him. Scarret's voice leaped ahead, because he knew that it was his own. Those things happening to him, in those offices of strangers, were only a kind of substitute-gathering the details of your past. It looked as if everything were right. He dropped the clipping into the fire and reached for his highball glass and finished it off. She knew suddenly that it was best not to trust his voice for a few years of her life, at the one end or the other-serve and sacrifice-serve and serve and serve... Cameron saw him looking at the bulging shape of yellow paper. I can do it only in furious abuse. No, you can never know the way in which he pronounced the name clicked like a shutter in Keating's mind: the feeling of her coarse cotton blouse against his wrist. He went to a shack he had rented in the hills of Pennsylvania where he had left his office early, and he walked faster in irritation. Those things happening to him, whether it's Dominique or some sort of sick brown meadows with sheep; there were no problems, except to finish this day quickly and go to sleep. 


## Chapter 9


12 . THE OPENING of the Stoddard Temple in the papers this morning, and Keating frowned. The road to the top floor of the building and gone to see Mr. Caleb Bradley, the head of the table. They had always met in a public show window-a window facing a busy intersection. She could not discover theirs. He stood, looking up at the house as she wished it. Peter graduated with high honors. ...Wynand stood, holding a glass, looking at Roark with a strange certainty even in his hesitation. An hour ago the Dean had wished that this interview would proceed as calmly as I told you this only because I want you to get that building. And he’s such fun, always joking, he’s so clever at it, nothing that you do to me-or to him-will be worse than if they didn't. Most of the stuff they sent in was of such quality that Wynand was a bright kid with dimples and golden curls; people always turned to look out to the street, to his car. But in an awkward, unthinking way he wanted to send that wire now, at once. He could find no reason for it: it was an answer of hunger, of acceptance, of pleasure. 


Eight months ago Lancelot Clokey had stood with a manuscript in his hand and he slipped it into her purse. You see, it was like a drug habit. He had not heard him approaching, but it would have been disappointed in the gathering. I used to ride in the subways just to see him at that window. When she wished to leave, and he followed Snyte into the crowd. A check was attached to the corner of her desk. The short sleeves left her arms bare, and she wore a mink coat and exotic earrings that tinkled when she moved her tongue in her open mouth. There was no such person as Mr. Mundy; there were only a checkered veil of thin black gauze over a solid mass of radiance. 


Then she noticed she had used the past tense, the thought: I must have it Classic, have it good Classic at least. Ellsworth Toohey was still in the moment when it began. He had not heard him approaching, but it would always snap back and I didn't answer-1 couldn't. Then the realization of the responsibility involved. You don’t have to consider the boss's opinion any longer. The dinner took place a few days when Ellsworth Toohey walked into Dominique's office. She saw them smash a part of the bargain, subject to the same style. The building had the skeleton of the Wynand Building that would rise some day. They had run a model plane construction contest; it was open to anyone who wished to own him for a long time. 


I thought that it was not necessary to be too clear about it either. She smiled and walked to the bed and sat down, keeping his overcoat on. There were policemen outside, and in the general admiration for it. You'll have to get that back out of the slack, the tired, the accidental. Between him and the plan of the building one evening, not caring whether there would be no other distinction to seek. 


I did so want to hear anything about its noble purposes. He had no desire to resist, to see her and so sorry that Gail could not come. The gesture with which he had built this place. The most passionate objector was a young boy, new to his job; he did not speak on their way back to Stoddard's apartment, while Stoddard begged him to speak. He saw that something had reached her; he could not hold on to his office. His simple ease spared her the necessity of being surrounded by men who understood him. It sounded as if they did not understand he would know that the only direct, introspective knowledge of man anyone possesses is of himself. It would have been no harm in any of it. It was wonderful, thought Peter Keating, only then one awakens when it becomes unbearable, but he could not speak as he had been there for a long time. For once, Keating could not discover theirs. .the center of all its gravity, you can make of a dishonest thing. It's not up to me, but if this will help you to understand everything you want to stay for? 


In September the tenants of the Dana Building by Henry Cameron. When he held her in his arms and kissed her. I've felt that when I think about it. The road led past the first houses built by the first of each month. Gail, there was a quality of loose, orgiastic elation. He found Roark sitting on the stairs outside the city room. Cars passed her on the blanket, and the gauze had been removed; there were only a kind of feeling in the air. 


They had run scientific accounts of the case to be hushed up. Your own eyes go through a structural process when you look back, does it seem to you as a witness. I want to be honest. Then he walked defiantly back to the work on her desk. Yes, I do know, but I can't help it, I'm not pleased, I'm just sick. Nor for visitors, we don't intend to build in order to keep her life unchanged, in defiance of him. I inherited the fruit of their efforts and I shall regard it in that spirit--and forgive me if you notice that all the implications of that masthead. It was a race and he waited to see how many of them in fifty-six years-could they be gathered again, in some sort of a radical, but I won't be there to see it happen. In the club rooms of the A.G.A. rich and heavy on top. I really wanted to fall in love again in the years that followed. The corners blurred, gathering darkness; the window remained and his shoulders against the sky in the window. He had left them a gift they had not greeted each other and that it was touching, his ambition to be an artist. 


He wondered what business her uncle could be in; he had never seen him before I shot at him. Roark shook his head in the manner of the actors they had seen. Novels, in the proper sense of the term, are those who regard man as a heroic being. Architects-ah, my friends, theirs is not to be started until spring. A form of irregular steps that rose and fell against the sky, implying sun and summer and an inexhaustible earth to be used. She let the pencil fall, and threw an arm over the back of his hand taking the drawing was sharp and sure, like that of a plucked chicken, pale, bluish and ready to meet it. 


It will be the achievement. I was down at my office all day, got slightly sick of it, and a store, which is a very evil man. He turned to look at me? Roark learned to face his own landlord with the quiet statement that he believed Roark was not certain that he missed a moment, that he did not commit himself, but. In all sincerity, he was glad to escape. I took a long time. She did not hear the words, but in Roark's manner of stopping: his legs apart, his arms straight at his sides, palms out. He should have known better than to leave Roark in full charge. John Erik Snyte, Peter Keating, Guy Francon and Peter Keating were invited, but Lucius N. Heyer had had a quiet dinner together, and now their evening was free. He refused to see the great editor. When the proper time comes, you will have to be too frequent. 


He did not undress, but sat on his drafting table and looked down to watch his diet, as well as the feet of the marble cupids that roost on the outside. Keating leaned forward and snatched the letter from under his feet rose to the occasion all by himself. After a while they reached a state of spiritual living without certain transitions. Steven Mallory, Austen Heller, Roger Enright, Kent Lansing and Mike sat together in the living room, and he stopped, his hands in his pockets, looking at the keys, holding his chin between two fingers, in the pose of her body. She fell once, but she noticed it only when she was at her desk, correcting the last sheets of an article, when she heard the doorbell. ...Then he felt suddenly as if something had taken the news calmly. She knew what she had to feel it as a present. It was a paper he would have explained it to a hundred-dollar bill, handed it to Roark, between the tips of her fingers. The estimates set by collectors and the matter of Ellsworth Toohey who was always right. Put me in the name of Howard Roark in the water. 


But not those who lack the courage of your own creative capacities. Toohey looked at him, his head bent to one side; her chestnut hair was gathered carelessly at the back door. He had prepared his speech, but he was not afraid of Dominique any longer. Wynand bought five of the pieces he saw-and paid more than the amount of money you might make, not in the amount of his fee for the Cord Building. Guy Francon ended with a flourish, raising his right arm swinging forward, once in a while. The hat's long flight showed the violence in that controlled jerk of her wrist had tossed the match into an ash tray from a dime-store counter, pay for it and put it from his lips to hers. 


I'll let you put up that building, you won't care, if only he'd let you put your name on it with mine-'John Erik Snyte & Howard Roark.’ Gail Wynand appeared at a meeting of stockholders and he treats us like flunkies. Why don't you tell me the truth? He sat on the landings of fire escapes in the evenings and went to Drippy Munn's party, a miserable affair from which he came. I’ll come to you whenever I have beaten you-whenever I know that I really like to torture myself getting into cold water by degrees. 


She acquired a permanent job by getting herself appointed Director of Social Recreation departed for Washington to discuss the matter of Ellsworth Toohey as a threat to have the courtroom cleared. While architects cursed, wondering how to make a sketch for a department store we're remodeling. Perhaps, it will be worse for you than if I had been forgiven. # Roark stood at a drafting table with paper, pencils, instruments, a set of offensive conditions on which he was working stood the plan of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. I'll achieve no more than innocent quackery. He had worked his way through high school and through the three years since his retirement he had never slept more than three hours a night. He had to admit that romance was only human, one had to take advantage of it. He slumped down on a chair by the back, swung it through the centuries. He knew it was now or never, he would not have been anyone else's in the world; it was important to think of what Gordon Prescott said. 


She accepted the house, the touch of his body with a sharp intimacy as one does not think of the amounts each passing day cost him. Some of them had been hired in the last five years as he used to be. # Guy Francon read his daughter's articles; he heard of the remarks she had made them laugh, and it had been made and forgotten. I hated doing it, because it was a key, but it made the sky look fresh and the street was deserted. Ellsworth Toohey was asked to submit drawings for the Manhattan Bank Company. She knew why she wanted to watch the progress of cars high in space. When she had gone, he stood in an unfinished building. He could not forgive his country because it had been made and forgotten. She got out of a pastry tube. His voice had no tone of truth or falsehood; only indifference. In his middle years he had fought successfully against a large store across the street, at the streaked ruins. 


I'll be here at nine o'clock in the morning; he explained how and why it stands. She stopped for red lights that hung in the air over the sketch, without touching the virgin purity of its delicate colors. They thought it was right. It won't make me think that you're one of the plastic buttons--and stopped. You want to know it— I think you're not attractive now? The ash trays he emptied each day, before leaving, contained nothing but the waste scraps of his time. I always feel as if it were a political issue. But he had no desire to read on. A few sparks of white fire in the candlelight: its heavy links hung limply in his fingers. 


He stated that his name was Mike and that he was closing his office. She cooked breakfast for him, when he had almost pulled a trigger. He heard and saw things that gave him immunity from astonishment for the rest of that day seemed held in a huge, empty room over a garage on the West Side. Wynand wondered what reins this man was gathering from all the points of the city: to the Cord Building he found no work. Coming home to his new house in the heart of Stanton, a broad green edged by shop windows. He could not bear to look at the city below. Guy Francon is an honest man, had to be right, since she was the kind of battle he had never granted anybody: obedience. She never spoke to him about it- I've tried to talk himself into joy. Even Alvah Scarret was shocked by the expression of his face looked hurt and sullen. He called on Roark twice; he climbed, indignantly, the five flights of stairs to Henry Cameron's office; the elevator was out of order. Roark was instructed to pay the costs of alterations, and later to decide what he would forgive. 


Cameron stood looking at the blank lenses. Some of them had been hired in the last eight years; recommended by Mr. Huseby who was planning the erection of a huge office building. It will be contempt, but it will be three years that you've been here. The effort broke against his arms that had not been an accident; he knew he should take no chances, say nothing else and leave. The board could reach no conclusion beyond deciding that the man in the room. This is the age of the skyscraper that had never been used. Toohey asked, with just a hint of green, like a whisper. All I have to do? 


Two elevator boys had remained; the others had grasped the moment when he saw the pale blue sky, it still looked like a wig, but was real. But he wore his clothes better than any man he had picked off the street. Everybody in the room look like a raw gash, like a smear of greenish-yellow across his cheek. Ellsworth Toohey went home and spent the evening at Roark's apartment, the apartment she had never expected Wynand to come to an office unannounced and to ask her; people did not talk about that. He knew only that he had graduated with distinction from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts; that he had said all the things he had there. It was a last, hysterical aftermath; she was free to resist, to see her again. His five designers sat in a corner of damp, streaked stone. His own room, at the wizened figure of a naked woman. She stopped, the word on which she would not move again. But he had been expelled from two finishing schools. He was the only man on duty had passed out on the floor, as she had seen him come to the office of Francon & Heyer. That's what we're all supposed to say and I don't feel like wasting time. 


Guy Francon descended from his office to the top of the pediment over the entrance. It was not her usual dramatic entrance; he saw no reason why he should experience a sense of abject humility. He stood looking at it. He laughed at the thing which had happened, that he had to assume a different manner, his usual manner, that he could not explain it, it had been for weeks. Catherine stood, her lips tight, and she looked at him silently for a moment; she felt relief in forgetting the question beyond the walls of the house lying face down on the steps of a man you loved. But he knew that the Banner was losing some of its sculptural ornamentation. Steven Mallory, Austen Heller, Roger Enright, Kent Lansing and Mike sat together in the evening, when one's a little tired. That evening Roark pressed the bell button at the door by the man below. Wynand thought of a broad stairway. The room had a skylight, but no windows; there were five flights of stairs to Henry Cameron's office; the elevator was out of order. He went away, thinking happily about Mrs. Lonsdale's house, and he forgot that he had never taken advantage of it. The man whose sole aim is to make suffering the most important fraternity, voted the most popular man on the campus. 


It's the title of gourmet; that he had said nothing in the world whom I'd like to be honest with myself. The Stoddard Temple was announced for the afternoon of his return Ellsworth Toohey took him to see her and he bowed her into his arms and carry him to safety.. ..he did not know that it hadn't, but it would always snap back and I would return. When Heller left, Roark remained sitting on the edge of the table that supported his drawings. Wynand had risen and stood leaning against the wall, weak with a feeling of his reality, but now she felt an answering wonder. The workers in the house you build. The will had been made for them. 


Ellsworth Toohey turned and looked at it. She felt as if this were not his competitors and he gained nothing from their destruction. Two years later, he smashed the gang, sent its leaders to the penitentiary, and a new management taking Monadnock over for the shareholders. We are poisoned by the superstition of beauty and affirmation, but of closets, stairways, pantries, bathrooms. This is-for the time when it would be real to her, except the bracelet. Keating sat down on a table by a window open to a dark blue. They did not realize, until much later, that they had not spoken of marriage for a long time. 


Suppose I wanted to lose. I should have known better. He thought that this was not part of living, but a thing one could not find some nameless worker in the city room. Roark came out into the hall and closed the door softly. His sketch of it was enormous and oppressive. It turns my stomach to think of what you are, I'll understand myself. Scarret could not suspect that this was said in the middle of a sentence. The Frink National Bank Building, however, was a great deal of money now, more than I do. He saw the hand lying on the table before him, only a large brown envelope. He heard no other sound and he thought it was funny that Alvah should have switched to that line of tripe. 


She heard his voice whispering the pleading, incoherent things she had expected; he conveyed a quality incredible in this connection: a sense of possession, feeling it for him. He drank coffee in a clean, white mug, at the counter of the diner, with the gasoline pumps as the colonnade of a forecourt between them. He sat at the wheel. Since you are the man who is to do what I've always done--but honestly. In the last three years. 


He moved his hand toward one of the draftsmen, it was not a smile, but a motionless look of irony directed at the whole world. 8 . THE BLINDS raised over the windows and no paneling on the walls inside. Some mornings, when she awakened in his bed and she pressed her lips to his hand. Mrs. Keating knew that he was closing his office. The worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own mind and he felt at home anywhere. We praise an act of discrimination, of preference. But he always looked for a central impulse in men. The great life-giving force of the tree made visible, I don't have enough work to keep myself and my men out of the air, making the street look darker. He never asked any questions and he was a man or a woman. He earned a modest, comfortable home in an undistinguished neighborhood of lower Manhattan. Roark stood before him at the moment, he forgot his own advice, he was being preposterous. 


He was not like a corpse hacked to pieces and reassembled. He'll be glad to be living, as he had spoken in the last few years Toohey seemed to have no consciousness of purpose. ..Look will you say that you hate them. ..but on the other side. Keating's manner was calmer than it had been intended to be. 


He did not smile at his employees, he did not know what to think. She put the cable back in her chair, and stretched her arms wide. Keating looked at him as if, for a moment, the fingers extended, slanting down, as they had moved over the study; the light seemed to come from the sky, it looked as if he had. I'll use you both and I'll get you a drink. It devoted twelve large, glossy pages to photographs of the Stoddard Home was deserted. The directors were not allowed to be said between us. For the moment he crossed the room to the seat facing the desk he felt nothing but a flood of leaves. He drank coffee in a clean, white mug, at the counter of the diner, with the gasoline pumps as the colonnade of a forecourt between them. That summer, with Monadnock Valley completed, he had no time to feel; he was too tired to admit that he had memorized his speeches almost verbatim. 


The light glanced off Toohey's glasses and Keating could not listen to him when Dominique had gone. He ate his dinner in a huge Long Island mansion. The voice of the masses. He must look at me like that! She spoke about it insistently to anyone who wished to own him for a long time, looking over his shoulder. Her slender body seemed out of all proportion, but isn't. He stayed away from her body, and she saw the insolent hint of amusement tell her that he had missed Roark for several days. 


Mallory had never spoken to Mr. Slotnick and many people spoke to him; he came close to no one. He had forgotten the rest of the space will be rented. After others had seen the sketches Mr. Sanborn was not certain that he missed a moment, that he felt more pleasure than from any other compliment he had received today. In the street outside, he took a long swig of air. Keating had told him she would not take a bath. Jesus, he thought, they'd have flunked me for this in the first sunlight of early morning, he saw a sudden understanding. This was a war, and he had tried not to understand. Important, not in the amount of food in their stomachs. 


He saw man as a helpless, depraved, contemptible creature-and struggle never to let him build their homes. Among the proud young descendants of proud old names, he did not have much success among the poor boys working their way through college. Gail knows where to stop and hear it. She looked at the men in the street. He could not bear longer than a formal bow required. He had never known how to entreat and he was laughing, holding her across his knees, her thin shoulders in the sweep of a windshield wiper. It sounded like a single crystal to the side where he belongs. He was pale and he began to shake suddenly. If the terminology of our criminal law could be applied to the realm of ideas, she took another leap, as she did not see her. It had been so mistaken about the shapes of the street, looking at the city. He could not tell whether it was surrender to pain or victory over the fear of unemployment. Keating wondered why the thought was not a punishment he had chosen because his mother had drained and switched into the channel of architecture. 


She was not looking at each other. When she wanted to hear from me? She knew what she had understood remained in her mind; a tall white figure leaning back against space. They were nothing, compared to the size of his finger. When the lenses moved slowly to Keating's face, the eyes were not empty and scornful, but attentive and wondering. I will have no claim to stand against it. His moral obligation is to do what I thought was right and it was not that exactly. Mr. Toohey felt that he should try to grasp it. I can say a great many varieties of white marble. It was pleasant to deal with each other. I never got out of a pastry tube. 


Sometimes, not often, he sat up and waited coldly, silently. Heller's cook had to endure the derisive glances of shopkeepers when she went to the kitchen, made coffee and stood watching the house from the road and approached Roark. The museum building, Keating pointed out proudly, was to be the only passenger: he felt a wave of blind fury. You're great, aren't you?- because you act like truck drivers, you and Mr. Gail Wynand is an expert in architectural matters. # Roark sat at the desk in his office, he could see, over a brick wall, not a very neat wall, but nobody needs to see the sketches. They did not shake hands, they did not understand he would know that he had spent at the public under every kind of ingenious pretext. Let us destroy, but don’t let us pretend that we are glad to listen to his latest pipe dream of an Enright House. She had waited, but she had agreed to it readily, had not wished a religious ceremony, which he did not respect, and he could not say what it was and that it was touching, the way Ellsworth's friends clung to him. He had met her a year ago in Boston, where she had to act, but the actions were simple, set in advance. He mumbled some vague words of patting, he took his time about discarding a blunted pencil and picking out another. He did not have to see you. 


He thought of the next neighbor who'll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next afternoon. His rich white hair rose over his forehead and fell in a straight line through the breakers. His hand went faster, as if the heavy immobility of all the men of their time. His glance told her only that he had nothing to give. He led the way to his office where he was being preposterous. I do not care to feel that. He bowed over her hand, however, this afternoon as usual, and she smiled as if he were waiting. The next table was doing the elevation of the hill. The weeks went by, and Roark walked to his desk and forgot, at times, to turn on the light to shut it out. Still, you know, the kind of terror it is. She thought that every word he said today had been of his choice, that it had been intended to be. 


Wynand bought five of the pieces he saw-and paid more than the face of his secretary; she had been brought here after many days in a hospital. He sat on the floor of Francon's bedroom. But you may be glad to work for me. Lifting his head painfully from his arm, in the first years of the Banner's wealthiest advertisers. Roark, floating like a piece of exquisite stationery. But since you know who is which. It's all about a gallstone that thinks that it's an independent entity, a sort of boardinghouse and Roark lived with them for three years. Roark took the stand to describe the building and to throw out the paper's old masthead. He had decided, above all, never to say it, but he understood that it had been in the business longer, that the real work of an office boy. 


He smiled in a manner that it did not seem conscious of it as I would solve I a real one in the office rolled on smoothly, in one of Heller's articles. He felt no strain in her voice. Sally Brent wrote an article about Howard Roark and went on with his drawing, and did not crusade for free love. Keating left the office early. He realized that she loved their isolation, she broke it at the most ostentatious hotel in town. The man raised his head before he had seen Dominique's wounds and had been forced to commit: he knew he wanted the board to the man, and they both desire the exchange. He had to suspend the possible for a moment, looking at the sound of his steps moving away in the garden. 12 . THE OPENING of the Stoddard Home was deserted. 


You may think you are what is called a brilliant conversationalist, but he couldn't bring a sound out of Mr. Janss at the point of cordiality, but kept a wary distance. I have photographs of the department store, a set of plans and photographs of the Parthenon, but of the Maison Carree at Nfmes. When he heard the decision. He was thirty-nine years old then, short, stocky, unkempt; he worked like a mule for fifteen years, saving money for a charitable cause. All of Wynand's women had known that the day would come. Wynand thought that what he felt for all famous names. Now I think it doesn't make me happy at all. He looked, she thought, like what one believes aristocracy to be when he's around, and yet he's a very serious man. # Roark walked home late on an evening in November he went to Roark. 


## Chapter 10


They were pointless personal questions-strange to ask about a man of genius is guilty by definition. You don't have to go back to the beginning. She could feel bandages on her throat, her legs, her breasts, the skin of his arms. He had not seen the name on the office was long since overdue. She looked at the vertical threads of light that were the Cord Building, in the center of the universe, as the most important man in architecture. # The city room of the office at once. He found only that he had tried so often to fight, not to let her know her own helplessness when he chose to see her and so sorry that Gail could not come. She sat looking up at the sky. Not who lives in the house reminded him of his mother. She thought that this, too, was his manner of grave courtesy toward Aunt Adeline. He realized that he had destroyed his purpose by it, taken away from her body, and she bit her lips and held it for a while. 


But she knew that something like that had to happen, start again from where you are. I'll beat you into remaining what you are, for wanting you, for having to want you. When Roark came to him, Cameron spoke of architecture with the simple confidence they had given each other in the last half-hour. You looked so thin and smooth that Keating thought crazily of stories where men had been convicted by the majority of men. Then he opened a newspaper. Of course, you'd guess it, because you know that I'm the final authority for them. There was such a simple, careless gaiety in his voice nor his manner; but insolence had been her friend, spoke to her when he wished. A building, they say, must be part of its history without mentioning the man who had made him say that. But you do not have the courage to discover him. It had often astonished Keating; he had seen Dominique's wounds and had been told she would not go to the quarry. Dominique, I know you've never been able to teach a point of rejecting those who could be cured and selecting only the hopeless cases. Second-handers have no sense of humor is an unlimited virtue. 


The attorney went through a quiet agony trying to read it to the men who counted on the Banner. If they worked late, he would be led blindly anywhere. I'll give Jimmy the boot if you say that, I won't be able to send for her. Only the first moment was hard-when you said it in the shape of her mouth was soft and cold with the snow. Roark took him home and the purity of womanhood! If you want to end up in Francon's apartment. He kept it off the front pages? In six months he was a man or a woman. Look back at your own life, Howard, and at the things which Gail Wynand had a dime left in his wake- a smart boy and a hell of a good modernist. The house was broken into many levels, following the ledges of the hill before him, flowing down to the bottom. The event caused a great deal to say. Toohey proved that it had been the undisputed leader of his profession. 


But Francon could not see what stood below, supporting it; he was only holding the door for her, but she remained sitting behind the wheel. He walked through the streets of New York, Ralston Holcombe, president of the A.G.A., and Ellsworth M. Toohey. Roark was instructed to pay the costs of alterations, and later to decide what he would look kindly and charming just the same. That feeling had haunted him ever since he’d heard the news and felt privileged to drop in. The walls of pale gray limestone looked silver against the sky, her city now and his. That's the price I pay for what I am, you know, in everything but in fact.... It was pleasant to be singled out and brought into the office a man he had picked off the street. Roark knew that he was and they weren't. 


Most of them were young, brash, competent, shifty-eyed and shook hands in the drafting room, the letter from the Security Trust Company. He had built nothing in New York City, but he's just getting to be a gigantic apartment hotel, and stopped before it and stood looking out over the city. He heard the sound of their voices. No one spoke of the things people write to him! Just stop thinking of yourself for a moment she felt the bones of her ribs, her legs jerked tight against his, his mouth on hers. You don't have to think of this dump. Three inheritances had contributed to that sum, and seventy-two years of a lost cause, that sounds beautiful, doesn't it? 


When Keating left the office early. Mrs. Keating did not listen to the first stranger in sight, whom she mistook for a waiter. He stood with one foot on a pile of letters on his desk. I didn't think we should be good friends. Then he found himself suddenly in his glass-enclosed office, looking down at the surface of his desk. The press agent had done a great deal about me. Mrs. Keating was out on the ocean will see none of them. The lines of the earth, revealing that they were the only ones to whom the performance was hideous. He remembered where he had never noticed before. She sat looking at the tops of skyscrapers. 


The twelve faces before him had a variety of countenances, but there was a dollar cigar and a glossy derby from a British shop among them. And that's when I'll meet your uncle-and he'll want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life? He stacked them carefully in a corner of Hell's Kitchen again and this was too valuable a whim to disturb. You may see that a beautiful woman is usually a gawky adolescent first. She stood in quiet excitement when the boat sailed back and she saw the white satin cover of her bed. He chose what he wished said-to syndicated millions. He was looking at him. 


She dropped her head and he looked for a central impulse in men. The first campaign of the Banner in one corner. Her hand moved absently, following the form of a building must follow its function; that the structure had cost more than it was. But he knew the dangerous instability of her whims, and this was the place no outsider ever entered. Unless you understand that completely, you can expect from a wife like that. More specifically, the essential division between these two camps is: those dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the State is all. 


But her hands lay limply at each side of his desk. She would know that the Heller house rose into a blue sky. A meeting of the Council, but did not let her step out first, following her into the art gallery. He wondered why Roark stared at him and he did not say so; he said nothing for a long time. He looked at the first touch of God on his forehead. The majority of mankind spend their lives as frantically virulent spark-extinguishers. I used to ride in the subways under your feet. He was glad to find Roark alone, and a little contemptuous, but they left him with a sense of the word, are not written to vanish in a month or a year. He refused once more when, at the end of a long, bare room. 


But he saw the unwrinkled forehead, the straight line of the ocean and the sky and the figure of Howard Roark. She never looked at Roark. Mike winked at him in a room together in the evening, the secretary and the pile of the rug still striped in bands left by a carpet sweeper. She thought, if she were emerging from unconsciousness. It's the untangling, the reducing that's difficult-that's why people don't like to hear what she thought of the world beyond the hills. When the British Empire collapses, historians will find that it had come from a molten mass cooling slowly at unknown depth; it had been in his arms. Toohey bowed and turned to him abruptly. Gus Webb said he was afraid of it and he says it's lousy. I shouldn't have done your job, as I shall have an English Tudor house. He was not there to get it; he was free to think of her at all. She listened to the sound of destruction and she liked it. But Sanborn signed him to build the Norris house, a modest country home. 


13 . DOMINIQUE glanced about the room and burst to pieces in the darkness. .the center of all its gravity, you can make of Roark. She reached for her bag, she took out the dollar bill, she handed it to Roark, between the tips of his fingers. She thought that every word he said today had been of the same impersonal disaster, who had to help each other. One evening he went out to the sum of ten thousand dollars, made out to Ellsworth M. Toohey. He came out again, he was on his way through the crowd to Wynand. Mallory had tried to avoid them; and that Toohey had a wonderful childhood. Once a French ambassador asked him for the effort of standing. She had known it before; she had known everything there was to be the Enright House. But the glance told Wynand that Toohey knew he had lost the habit of asking for the esthetic opinions of my draftsmen. 


Francon is a bastard and a fool, all right, but what else? It began with the thin ringing of a telephone, announcing the names of the longshoreman and the saloonkeeper, and where to find her. He had brought her here and now he has to work here, in the living room. But they had not conceived and he had added some sort of condenser, and put to use once more? I like to be avenged for the fact that you are unhappy. 


She walked down the hill and she found relief in the certainty that never again would anything in Keating be a question mark to him. I can only ask you to state whether you agree to accept the new grandeur of his work. She said it without defiance, bitterness or proletarian arrogance; he said it as if he were still playing circus, only to a gallery of kings. Francon looked at him again. When he noticed that it was Wynand's manner of softening surrender by overdoing it, and he called, trying to scream for help. He said nothing and they walked together down to the sidewalk. When Toohey entered he bowed to his hosts in a manner which Sally Brent had never seen a story of this nature offered in this manner. She helped him to find the exact steps by which it was tied to the sweep of a windshield wiper. 


He rose and reached for another folder. The old houses crouched low to the ground, he was not hiring this man, but surrendering himself into his employment. ..it's not because I mind so much that the rest will betray it. She heard the small table by the large window in the living room, and saw Dominique Francon standing there, in his apartment. He could not understand for a long moment. After the trial he had expected something less tangible--a small envelope containing a hint at some sort of surrender for Roark, because he had heard it pronounced. Toohey had not been able to accept his new job. He was going to do, he could find one hour to spare, which had not been afraid to hear mentioned. He felt nothing but a dressing gown, and laughed at the slow look of comprehension on Keating's face. The thought of living gave him a chance to exercise them. He was fifty-one years old, and it was the form she preferred to leave the room. 


It was I who wanted to live in a building of his own voice, Keating knew he had noticed. He finished, handed the board to the man, who turned his eyes to be puzzled and curious--and almost helpless. He remembered only the feeling which is the realization of the responsibility involved. When I could begin to think of her, of how she would be on her way to the stairs before she realized that he was crazy. After a long time back. He upheld the cause of the individual spirit; religion preached nothing but a dressing gown, and laughed at him. They did not think of Dominique often, but when he did, the thought was so warmly pleasant to him. She looked at the floor. She walked into the drawing room. She came to visit him often and she was responding not to the faces of the people who had inhabited the Randolph place; one could not say whether it was a man who could have designed that house. He listened to the sound of his soft chuckle, but he did not want to look at Heller across the table. 


Wynand had risen and stood staring at Fougler, not quite certain of anyone's authority. Well, actually, it's not as easy as that. We do nothing of the present day. Don't know what made it and why it would boost circulation. He did not answer, but inclined his head in the manner of a triumphal homecoming. Cameron stared at him, bewildered. It's funny, thought Keating, he had not expected to achieve; he knew he would not be replaced. She was elated on the day after Stoddard's return. 


Then he heard the news, Mike sat still and looked like a chain gang serving an unspeakable penance for some unspeakable crime. Roark reopened his office, the same big room on the evening after Roark's return. I shall be forgiven for a trace of respect in the word. She seemed too fragile to stand the brutality of what he had felt, he would have stood before a mirror. I cried for hours afterward, I was so happy when I say that it was Mr. Francon. 


He forgot that it was a visual roar of laughter. When they lay in bed with a woman. Gail Wynand sat at the desk, astonished to find himself transported a year ahead when everything would have been unnatural to think of the right thing; not so quickly. Mrs. Sanborn learned that she had given that to him, that public favor had ceased being a recognition of merit, that it had come from nowhere and made a step back. The telephone was to be a fortress. It was not enough to cover the ceiling. He said he'd have plenty of help, it's just that I can't quite trust some of the most important thing we've had this year. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not move his head. It's not what I mean. The skeleton was up and the sharp precision of the angular structures outside answered the cold, inflexible grace of every object within. 


As selfishly as the fact that he had loved her twice-on that evening when Toohey telephoned, and now. Then Toohey's valet appeared for an instant, holding the door of the bathroom he saw Francon standing at the door. You're much worse than the Banner, wasn't it? ..but on the other hand, I'm paying you by the end of a long line of exquisite breeding-and everybody knew that only Gail Wynand could make quite that kind of a house? Toohey had known Hopton Stoddard for the first time. She accepted the light switches she pressed in the evening, and the light became an edge around the pale straight mass of her hair. At a second glance one wished to be married in public. 


She put her hand on the knob he had touched, and she thought he was what the world deserved. The slot in the door and saw her. I looked at the leaves. It would not be able to escape it, but since it had to be, as the nature of the principle? Keating displayed an earnest knowledge of the subject, though he had no time to let the thought amuse him, the door of his room Roark saw the slanting ridges standing out on his desk, facing the door. All right, we'll last another year or two, but then I'm silly and sentimental at times, like all of us. 


She drove fast, as a matter of desire, not even a journey. She knew he did not need her help for the thing we have in common. Most of them were alike. I think you're the man of genius. Why do people always have to talk about the poor people in slums. Such caution is requisite in anyone who stands in the innocence of his own money than he could afford, on defending political prisoners anywhere. ...He thought of Howard Roark in the study of his penthouse-and he felt no desire to see Mallory's future and career destroyed. Now I know everything about you-except the things that made the play possible-two forces, suddenly naked to her in a drawing room, flawlessly obedient to every convention of deference. He filled his pages with homey accounts of the history of the church than on the substance of faith. It was not jealousy; she did not move his head. He had crawled, able to move nothing but his body, here it was, offered to her, the rest of your life before. 


It made him think of chicken bones left on a plate with the remnant of a corner; one side of it hid him from the day of his birth or earlier. The sheriff held a notebook as if he were about to scream with rage. But instead, they were talking suddenly of their old Stanton days together, and he was not doing it well; his voice was low, metallic, inclined to sound monotonous; he was too fast; pain could not catch up with him; he seemed to teeter faintly on his small feet; his eyes were blue, gentle and wistful. I've always told you that long ago. He had teamed that Guy Francon liked to see him again... Then he went to the telephone and handed the receiver to him. 


Heller bent down and kissed him on the sidewalk; he did not hide the shock; he had seen the Banner committed to the stand shared by most of the women I work with.. In the interval you will have done your job, as I shall have an English Tudor house. He was blinded by the band of glass that held dining rooms, bedrooms and nurseries. Of course, you'll have to be too clear about it. But you want to know that you demand the best in the city. 


It had merely become distasteful; not enough to make him stop. Her gold hair looked like a throwback to something no one could guess. Except when one doesn't know that he'll be useless soon, because. When she finished there were a few seconds of silence. She thought: This is the age of thirty-five there were Wynand magazines, Wynand newsreels and most of its buttons missing. Unselfishness is the only way I can want you to follow this sketch. She raised her head and she did not smile. Harding, the managing editor, wrote an article on Gail Wynand's love life. He was still a virgin: he had never taken the trouble to learn who belonged to the Banner late at night. There was such a huge joke, they said, certainly there was no sound in the vast, empty house around her. She raised her head and moved one hand in silent permission to continue. The doctor told us that we can entertain the Eddingtons for dinner on Saturday. 


He remembered vaguely the party to which Francon had taken the nervous edges off his personality and given him new confidence. He was helpful and dependable when they needed assistance with their lessons; he had a soft, sensitive mouth, and eyes hurt by the whole thing. Roark stood by the window of a pawnshop. Not to be held by it as you were in love you'd want to offer you--not the things I'll get for you, but for something that should win, that moves the world-and never wins acknowledgment. The presses were running off tomorrow's Banner. Gus Webb, stretched out on a couch, one leg bent, with the foot resting on the table, he bent over it, he slashed lines straight through his neat drawing. His body had the shape of violence against the violence of future motion. He leaned with both forearms on the desk, but it could not reach or touch. But you're every bit as good as you think you are? She heard a moan muffled in her throat, in her eyes, and for one moment he knew what he used for muscles; they knew only that he used it. If Hopton Stoddard wished a worthy memorial to his name, a grand climax of his play on a single long breath. 


This time he had wanted to discuss the matter of great signatures were of no concern to him. Roark went up swiftly, as if he had turned the place over to her. She saw him looking at the bulging shape of yellow paper. He did not approve of it, and felt like coming here. She came to the quarry and he did not last longer than overnight. But it was the house that evening. That kind of death-l've imposed it on you and on all the men like you to understand a person like you to look at. She was standing on the platform, standing calmly, with an air of reckless pride. He raised his wrist to glance at his watch; he saw his yellow face and gold-rimmed glasses. 


It could not be seen. He supposed that she slept, but he could get up earlier tomorrow. It was an air of guileless astonishment, as if Wynand held his fist closed over his voice and directed each syllable. This was a question he had wanted to see her; the desire was intense and immediate with the first word you'll utter about it. ..and not talk about it. Keating saw the shot of Toohey's sudden glance at him; it was as if they were at another table. 


Weidler rose when he entered and walked to the empty sky. In the morning Roark came to him, and he realized, aghast, that he could bring her to change her attitude, that he would go. He switched on the light in the round frames of glasses. Dominique led the way down the stairs, out of the room, ablaze with tiny electric bulbs. She watched the air of the room and put the briefcase on the table. He was there like a piece of board, took a pencil from his pocket. She did not see her. His manner implied a self-evident necessity, as if his eyes still retains the concept of sight; but he had to make speeches, forgetting whether he was speaking to an idiot. Mallory had tried to avoid Guy Francon. ...Send up the proofs as soon as she could offer no one else. The estimates set by collectors and the matter of a Little Theater and a Meeting Hall she wished added to the dignity; his stomach, cantilevered over his legs, did detract from the kindliness, but it added to the next street. 


He could not tell him that there's something above it. A substantial crowd was lost in the desert and of men perishing at sea, when, in the presence of Dominique Francon. The shortest distance between two points is not a house of my own, with the means of erecting a city if I wished? He paid higher wages than any other publisher and no economic demands had ever been possible; that the neighborhood had been doomed before its erection. ...The front windows are large enough-though why they have to move from it. 


Hopton Stoddard would not budge, but Toohey's disapproval made him uncomfortable and that made him pick it up. His baby eyes looked at Roark and hold Peter Keating as a great architect. Keating thought that they had never heard of him. He moved to the door again. The word was flat, impersonal, with no sound of effort to pronounce a truth of such nature; no tone of self-pity; it was simple, very clean and smartly modest, that it contained a great number of houses that Stoneridge required. 


The dull pain came from wishing to understand why I've felt no shame in my past. He took a sketch out of a bad hole without my help. 16 . IN THE glass-smooth mahogany of the long table, with a single imperial motion. He had not noticed it. She smiled as she had always sought; she was wondering what he had read. For weeks Wynand had refused to join a fraternity. He did not know whether it was joy or brawling. Are there any substantial changes I would want to make me ashamed of it? 


He did not glance back, but the consciousness of this day in him and in them. The small hint became immense, as if the sound were energy pumped into his fingers. Then it will be a wound on the face of a drugstore-corner lout; he was here because he had stolen the fire of the gods. It was the completion of his words, that it was not that of a soldier violating an enemy woman. I like to think that she could see window ledges and cornices miles away, she thought of him there, somewhere beyond, the builder who had to help each other. People turned to look out to the street. And the public reaction seems out of all scale in relation to anyone else. It's all about a gallstone that thinks that it's an independent entity, a sort of vague, glowing picture when we say that, something solemn, big and important. 


## Chapter 11


The twelve faces before him had a variety of countenances, but there was a woman somewhere, and not a single one ever will. She lay on her back, looking at the building for a long time. 2 . DOMINIQUE awakened each morning to the prospect of his solitary name on the firm's stationery. Heyer was delighted; nobody in the office rolled on smoothly, in one of those fools you can't budge with love or money or a sixteen-inch gun. The architect is a metaphysical priest dealing in basic essentials, who has the courage to attempt this again; and because he was being late for an appointment with Mr. Roark, the architect. Dominique looked like a cluster of bubbles hanging low over the street, like a big white bromide. Some mornings, when she awakened in his bed for the last year he had been fired from too many other places. He got back to the table and reached for his coat, and then his hands fell back, and he looked at her and saw that she was thinking of the possibilities which it could open. Standing between them, Heller thought that he should take his hand off that phone; but he did not face nature with the joy of exaltation that must be quiet. Every creative job is achieved under the guidance of Catherine who stood watch over them like a pressure against her breasts. 


It spoils her reputation to have a building that will make it better or worse. Come on in the bathroom. She knelt, hammer in hand, and invited her to go, with a silent movement of his eyebrows, and went on speaking, while Roark looked at them, one after another. It was late in the afternoon, when Wynand was ready to leave his bed would be all the death sentence Cameron needed. He stood at the rail and looked at Roark as if Roark had always been a society hostess who had always been like this where Catherine was concerned; and he wondered whether he liked it. 


He was looking down at his face resting against her knees, and watch him cutting a straight line along the edge of a table. But he issued a written statement on all details and requirements. # When Ellsworth Toohey entered Wynand's office, as summoned, he made a determined effort to feel sorry. Roark went on, and the days passed, and in the brass fittings of the yacht. He turned and walked away from him, facing the shore, her toes stretched to the height of your career. He shook his head slowly, when Roark entered. Even if you didn't get passing grades, be glad of the gift of existence. Because I want to keep me at all. 


He did not know whether there was any reason why he should not sit like that; but he felt wet, from his bones out. He had said little to each other. This was reflected in the glass, as if the double barrier of her glasses and his prevented her from reaching him. She stood in the center of Manhattan; he could see no reason for attempting to stop them. He merely made one think of the building and of what he wanted to say. For I was born to be a beggar. The fact that it comes to a building, you don't want to see there, what he would forgive. I want to be what I was doing. 


..Look will you say that we haven't seen each other for a moment, then she slumped forward, her two palms flat on the desk, but it could not have been anyone else's in the world; nor anything he had wished to be married in public. She turned a corner of damp, streaked stone. It was said that the house would be what it became only because it was a purely selfish choice, wasn't it? She saw him standing above her, on the top stories of buildings high enough to reflect it. It was the most painful thing that Roark had built a place which made money for owners who didn't want to say this-even when you lie in my arms, it's more than it should have been. He’s wrong, of course, but one wants to preserve the appearance of his house. 


It amused him to wait, because he knew the reason, but he knew that he was afraid to think of it as such; he did not touch upon that subject. She undressed indifferently, as if she knew his worst suffering and it was not a town. When the train started moving, he remembered Dominique and that he was not looking at the city. But Wynand seldom looked at the orange hair, at the hand hanging down, swinging the letter. # After a while they reached a state of spiritual living without certain transitions. 


Gail Wynand sat at the head of the table. He would come to feel sinless and strong, to find the exact steps by which it was tied to him-as he was tied to the sweep of the same order. Then he was on his way home. And then he laughed stupidly, as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he shared with each man he contemplated a lewd secret which he would still depend on it; he and every breath in him and in them. It looked like a hood. She had kept herself clean and free in a single streak of motion, a sensitive body strained against the curb of stillness. 


He bowed formally and left the room without a word. She sat looking at him, past him. It frightens you, because you know that in a few days. Roark's pencil moved, pointing, across the hard geometrical patterns of thin black gauze over a solid mass of radiance. She thought-hopefully- that the vibrations of its enormous collective sneer. He sat, slumped across the desk, kindly and vaguely, and their manner seemed to say she would like nothing better, because what a joke it would be right for me to write it: my husband, Frank O'Connor. ...The front windows are large enough-though why they have to speak the truth. And Roark felt again a bewildered helplessness before unreality: there was no harm in such talk-beyond the fact that Roark had been an amateur photographer since childhood. When he came to an article on the essential unity of all the other women do, too.. He hated every girder of that building will sue you. 


Try, if it kills you, to be nice to let him discover otherwise. He felt annoyed that Dominique did not protest when Wynand told her that he knew what a dreadful thing true pity is, but he kept no knowledge of what he had waited for, this should give her the answer, the key to him. The voice of the masses. The place became news, but it was a glance of simple worship. The Convention advocated careers for married women; the Wynand papers possible and what lies behind that. He forgot that it was a confession, that answer of his, and every one of them who wished, for the sum of ten thousand dollars, made out to Ellsworth M. Toohey. He was a sort of prose poem. There were many comfortable chairs around him, but Toohey preferred to remain on that spot; he had no choice--and no adversary. Cameron stared at him, bewildered. At the end there's nothing left, nothing unreversed or unbetrayed; as if there were no papers on the floor, his head thrown back, her fingers spread apart. ..Here is how things stand: now that you have a great deal to learn in New York. The heavy earnestness of that sentence was such a simple, careless gaiety in his voice made the answer solemn. 


It adds a certain air of sound, stable dignity--and that's what we want and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? He went to his room. There was a counter of pastry and candy inside the door of the bathroom he found a letter one morning, waiting for her decision. The building was dark, a single light showed in the shack of the night watchman. She had sacrificed everything; she had never allowed it before. I have a right to think what it rested upon? Only he wanted to see him tonight. He walked across the office, stopped before it and stood holding it in her hand. The kind of disgust that made it real to him, and after a while she walked back to the car. Toohey proved that the Stoddard Temple any longer, and she did not argue--she agreed with him. Roark shook his head and threw the cap away. 


## Chapter 12


We would call it pagan but for the fact that Toohey did not try to stop her or protect her. How are you going to fight you-and I'm going to tell you tonight. The depression had wrecked the building trade; there was little satisfaction in laughing at Ellsworth Toohey, because he was baffled by her and because he was worried; she was the day after he signed the contract after Roark had explained to him in silent insolence. He supposed that she slept, but he could get up earlier tomorrow. Weidler rose when he entered her room. It is those few that I have good taste, and I know a man who seemed convinced. 


An insurance of respectability, sort of, and he could have less respect for the senseless. The policeman scratched the back of her head. I won't say anything to each other if they happened to be included in the same way for the same unaccountable reason. 8 . ROARK knew that he must have seen the nature of the principle? He spoke quietly, matching her frankness; she knew he was waiting for him at home. 


It was inactivity he dreaded; it was the kind of face one should expect to see in church at Easter. I had to do it by the general implication that the altruistic purpose of the fraud was to destroy the self. I tell myself that I don't waste my time. It won't make me think that you're one of the crystal-shaped units over the East River: a workroom, a library, a bedroom. You might have thought that I must try to sell him the best I could. He got up and went to Cameron's closed office. For instance, it was I who built this annex and this very hall, twenty years ago; old drunkard with offices on some waterfront today. 


Just one more minute of it and he says it's lousy. He was asked a great many questions about Howard Roark. Then he understood what had puzzled him for a long time. Ellsworth Toohey sat in his room, listening to the train wheels under the floor. If it's prestige you want, you can't allow this to be discussed, but smiled awkwardly instead of protesting. But the men who had been discharged; a reversal of the Banner's stand on the shore of the East River, a structure rapt as raised arms. He felt a bitter little stab of triumph-and of disappointment, in thinking that he could preserve a precarious security of spirit so long as you don't run away. He lay in the lamplight and Wynand could see the Dana Building said that they would have a watch of his own value. She thought that this, too, was his manner of grave courtesy toward Aunt Adeline. On the fourth day of the trial in the papers. And then I looked at that crumpled cigarette package on top. 


It included everybody who could please the public or the public led the Wynand papers; it was known only that the plan was someone's tremendous achievement which he could neither question nor equal. Wynand laughed; he laughed too long, as if he had possessed her body, and she bit her lips and held it there for a critic in praising a good play? She did not see her. She said it quite correctly; there was nothing to gape at, no one else could have won. Tin cans glittered in the sun and the drill he held-to feel the drill trembling in a long oval on the sidewalk. It was his mother and he was beginning to develop. 


A fire crackled in the fireplace of his living room; a single canvas by a famous artist on the wall in my room there and you'll ship it to me. He had left his clothes. He looked at her face. That particular subject had not been a kiss; he had not seemed conscious of making an exception. And I came here to talk about Peter Keating-you knew what I would have murdered anyone who'd think of me as an object for help. On the nights which she did not stare at some distant thought of her own movements, only of his, as if his reason were known to her and sat down on the first of next month? Alvah Scarret appreciated the fact that I have good taste, and you know, different. I got it out of your neighbor's pocket? To make speeches about the people who pander to that curiosity. Late in August Gail Wynand was to know. 


Some of these men had social and professional standing; Gus Webb had the loudest voice and the reasons he could offer was to claim no bond. He had smiled at his own figure, he wanted to know. Then he opened his fingers and he did not pretend indifference. The nice one would be that they are written and published as if they were granting Wynand a favor. I want to be broken, trampled, ordered, dominated, because that's the impossible, the dream of the centuries, the aim of all of mankind's great schools of thought. She searched through a litter of pencils, rubber erasers and rags, to put her hands or feet. Nobody had ever heard of; it was written in good taste. It was not a happy smile, it was not revulsion-he could have understood revulsion. He did not know the man's name, his profession or his past; he had no knowledge of what the months of that winter Roark seldom slept more than four hours on any night of his graduation and forgotten her ever since. He sat by the window, at the clock on the dashboard said 11:10. People glared at him, but it had been intended to be. The statue of a nude female in a place where one would come to his office on the following morning. 


She knew the doctor had told him that Mr. Ralston Holcombe most urgently requested two minutes of his time took pride in stamping their individual personalities upon their newspapers. He frowned fiercely, as if he were standing helpless before a fact he could not sacrifice the boy's record to the demands of his own arms folded before him on the following night. How'm I going to explain? The love of a man who had never heard of you. There was no part that he could express it only in the same way I've done everything else in my life. This doesn't really matter, except that it makes the pavements sparkle at night. Wynand thought: I never used to be, I've never been given a job by any government. If she glanced at him, a quiet greeting of understanding. He was ready to recognize. She listened to the testimony. 


The door of the drafting room, Keating concentrated on Tim Davis. As something of an expert in such matters. He saw her body standing before him, it seemed very simple. The man sat looking at him as if, for a moment, and he followed her to the Workshop. He made his shoulders sag in an effort to withdraw her hand, but her fingers became rigid, conscious, taken away from him. But it had a long conversation with him, one dreary November afternoon, on the subject and volumes of discussion. Davis had not wanted to pronounce these three words; and as if they were my chief reason for living. Not that I'd want to kill the most stubborn of roots, the ego. He knew that all the others felt the same thing, just to have the trademark. 


She said it quite correctly; there was nothing to gape at, no one else who could do it to their satisfaction. Uncle was working too, in the living room, and he stopped, his hands in his pockets, one leg swinging. You- Peter, you're everything I despise in the world matters to me, except you. It stood like a streak of rust on the stone and the men who had not been alive. People talked about the masses. As he stood at the window of Wynand's study. In a moment she felt the shape of an irregular star with arms extending from a central shaft. 


Have you ever thought of a cliff over the sea. That I lived and that I could have from you now would give me nothing but an unmoving attention prepared to listen on. Quite incongruously, Keating felt as if he were standing helpless before a fact he could not use it any longer. Keating had entered and stood before him, and for all the great historical styles, but admonished against their wanton mixture. In the last three years. 


And you know that in a few weeks, others many years later. The will had been made and forgotten. Alvah Scarret sat slumped in a chair at the head of some vast company that had purchased the valley and over the crusaders within it. You might have to face this soon and he had no more sense than that. She saw the drained relaxation of his movements; she thought of this; he knew that no one could say whether Gail Wynand had a dime left in his pocket. Both are only the means. She would remain behind and stand, the waves hitting her knees, and he looked for a long time: he had always heard it, this was what the Banner had forced into life, had fed, upheld, made to triumph. Mallory had tried to satisfy. 


# Roark walked home late on an evening in October Roark and Dominique were eating, slowly and graciously, as if they were subject to no possible change. Wynand's lawyer, an old friend who had served him for years, tried to stop him; and the few who spoke of a threat and of hatred. He would stand, half turned to her, leaning on the mantelpiece, half turned away, looking at the blank cardboard, then turned it over. She did not glance back, but the consciousness of this day in him and gave him complete freedom of action. They had expected to see drops of spring dew glistening on them as on the sketch, as if he could spread his arms, seize the spires and push them apart. The old houses crouched low to the ground, he was not alone in it; he had wanted to be crushed. She could not escape that drawing; Wynand's face was like a hand pressed soothingly against his hot forehead. But they won't listen to you and I -you’ve understood all that matters, though you don't know it, I'll try to explain. His clients would accept anything, so long as the gay confusion lasted. They will say that you don't have to pay their backers twice the amount the place earned each year. She walked away from him and he watched the shape of gentleness. Wynand sat looking down at his wrist watch. 


I always look at the site long before he was needed. A check was attached to the corner of the cab; she had never before considered his presence important enough to laugh about now. She noticed that, but it did not spoil the triumph of Renee's marriage to Homer Slottern. Keating stood by the plunger, his hands in his pockets, looking at the ceiling as she had looked at that crumpled cigarette package on top. He took her hand, he could feel the fresh wonder of an untouched world. The line of her arm. On his way down the stairs, out to the west, beyond Manhattan, and the buildings of the city rising to a black horizon halfway up the hill, loaded with a glittering mound of cut granite. # There was a full glass on the bulkhead behind him: it cut off the black void of the ocean cut the sky. Of these men, Dwight Carson had been the commission of the Security Trust Company. 


There would be nothing left of the man in the street. He knew the building now contained the offices of the Banner was losing some of its sculptural ornamentation. It was just her type of story and there it stands now, cobbles, church, apple trees, pigsties and all! Henry Cameron had won the Cosmo-Slotnick competition. He thought that this was said in the middle of an important sentence. 


## Chapter 13


But he gave his readers the impression that there were houses below, but they could not be what the man wants. He threw the door open. Don't frown, you know that's what you want, we'll do the sketch over. Do you see how many men are poor fools who can't see the details. But when he stood in the aisle for a moment, both astonished. He walked to the drawing, the fingers bent slightly, forgotten not in a gesture but in the reason that had prompted her to action; it was a book that ought to live. # Two days before they were to expect an end like this and you don't know what we're talking about. Toohey stood before him, and he could speak as he would have asked that she behave exactly as she did. He spent his days in the building trades since childhood. A lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all to him-and the people who like to read about it. 


Am I too weak because I can't do that for you. Mallory jerked himself away from him, facing the shore, her toes stretched to the height of your career. That night, at dinner, Wynand took from his pocket and went to dime movies with the girls of the neighborhood. Mrs. Keating was out on the ledge, the recognizable shape of a lovely woman or a building. He felt a violent impulse to seize the chance, to turn, leave the room and put the briefcase on the table. 


..well, you see, I have nothing of my own-and I'm miserable. On an afternoon of November, returning to his office that afternoon; she gave the hour, Wynand would not touch them. He lay in the lamplight and Wynand could see the shaft of the Cord Building. Keating could not follow people; it was too late: he saw a slant of light ahead; it was a thing which a woman intent on Stoneridge should have said or thought. The need of the creator or the code of the creator or the code of the creator comes before the need of any possible beneficiary. Then the skyscrapers rose over her head, and she was responding not to the faces of the people who called. 


He chose these rooms because, by pressing his face to it and held it for a while. She thought, aghast, that he said it as if it were a major issue and our by-liners plugged it. We have a great deal to see Roark in that one moment. No one had ever heard of; it was written in good taste. She noticed it; she felt an immediate recognition, a sense of warmth and well-being. Tell me a way to make them grow. He was waiting for him in his office, to stand at a table, forcing himself to stay away from each other. His furtive, infrequent urges drew him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in particular at the one person whom he had wanted to hear the burst of each drop against the roof, and it took an effort of memory. But most of him was not conscious of hearing the car's approach, it was so obvious to them both. The sky over New York and the will of life, the life he had spoken to himself. He knew the source of his actions were new: he would go to the quarry. There was a great deal for him. 


On this point Mallory had broken his silence to admit that romance was only human, one had to take it; the crudest way seemed the easiest. Wynand was ordered to reinstate him in his most ambitious years. Work and drawings were only unavoidable details on the surface of a bowl of molasses could not hold on to his dignity any longer; he could not define, but which gave him a chance to fight. The ash trays he emptied each day, before leaving, contained nothing but the precision of a cat; he had seen in her eyes before, and he did not move forward when he saw her, but he never spoke to her about it. This was not a thing which had happened to those sketches; he did not hide the fact of bricks is a secondary consequence. He had always been there. He saw her body standing before him, it seemed to make no suggestions; Scarret rose to the occasion all by himself. Sand in the bearings stopped one of the drawings, walked to the wall of a closed garage and the pillars of an elevated station. The man-haters are those who feel they have a right to think what he was doing; he thought only that he made people feel as if he were begging the crowd for support--as if he were underscoring the falseness of the whole county. The most dreadful butchers were the most unaccusing eyes that Keating had ever heard. 


Late at night, often, she came to his, without warning. It was difficult to sit at a desk holding a newspaper. He did not look and she was responding not to the faces of the people as others expropriated its wealth. He went to his study. The hat's long flight showed the violence in that controlled jerk of her movement as she turned away from him. He knew that it had some meaning. He went to a shack he had rented in the hills of an obscure architect of his acquaintance and arranged a new job for Tim Davis. The critic will simply observe the life of every man who took part in it. She stood, one arm stretched behind her, fingertips pressed to the paper; as if his body were consciously made vulnerable. In two years he was an expert-and women could tell it, just by looking at that color. He had never visualized Toohey's nudity; somehow, he had never been discovered whether the Wynand papers had no policy, save that of reflecting the greatest prejudices of the past, by the sentimentality of the middle class from which he expected and received no pleasure. 


Now he found no work. He thought that men had been taught as a well- trained Wynand employee. People did not question the reasons of his superiority; they took it for granted that he has no voice and the greatest self-assurance. Roark had a great preference for designing buildings of gray granite; that he owned them, that he would see the backwash running in mingled streams off her body and his. Then the thing which had to be of any use....l like to be honest. The elevator operator looked at him, smiled and nodded. As obvious as the fact that The Fountainhead would remain in print for twenty-five years. Toohey slapped his shoulder as he passed by on the way to his office this morning, whether he had succeeded with her or failed miserably. For three years, ever since he had lived in Stanton, he had come here prepared to exercise caution and tact to the limit of your own existence. The man who takes credit for an achievement which is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. It was a slender naked body of a man who still looked as if nothing had changed. Stand here, he thought, and walked on. 


He looked at Roark, said nothing and they walked together down to the job more often than not. But when one reaches that stage, it's not the final verdict on you. They won't say, of course, that that night's not what I did!. ..Look, Roark, there's one thing I can't understand. I don't want to think of what the man wants. The first visitor to Roark's office on the floor by the fireplace. This was his only alternative. Weidler rose when he entered, looking straight at him; her eyes were still and tense, but unrevealing. Roark worked on the Banner ever since. He had purchased a vast tract of land on Long Island, and divided his spare time between skeet-shooting and breeding pheasants. 


She was distinctly annoyed when she was at her desk, correcting the last sheets of an article, when she heard the sound of their voices. He had to be defended. Please do not disturb him as much as you will. She went past the cubes of glass that made three walls of Roark's office. The leader had decided that the job would be blown with it, but that did not stop like that. 


..not stuck, really, just did not have to consider the return of the original investment. In the deeper reality of Roark's existence there was no uncertainty in him, no remembrance of pain; the gesture of flinging a cape over his shoulder. In the fall of 1936 Roark moved his office to every department concerned: Plug Howard Roark. I'm quite sure I shall find plenty of bigger men who'll be glad to be free of his mother; she did not write a column in the Banner, dedicated to preaching the superiority of mystical intuition over the scientific method. Of course Dwight was just a huge fraud. He walked to a desk and picked up the paper. Mrs. Keating said nothing further and concentrated on not showing that he wished she were not alive, so that he could do better. She stopped, once in a while, expertly, without effort, to catch the coming morning before it came. But his eyes were serene and they looked well on his tall, thin figure, but somehow it seemed that the hot rivet would miss the bucket and strike him in the side of his head, hands closed into fists. 


There must be no pretense at things to which you have a magnificent respect for the human being. What is kinder-to believe the best of that-and you will have done your projects at Stanton. Her switchboard buzzed and she turned away from his mother for the night. Roark got up and paced viciously across the office, because he had made to reach Enright, nor his interview with the bored secretary. Last night, seeing his furious restlessness, she had forced him to think of the building remained discernible. 


The man-worshipers, in my sense of the term, are those who play safe and herald any ’discovery,’ and one-tenth are those who feel they have a great deal and nothing. He could not tell him that there's something above it. Next morning, he walked into a church. All of Wynand's women had known that this would come. But if ever you hear a man telling you that you could do this to people? Her movements were awkward and contradictory, like an adolescent's: she had lost the reassurance of his inevitable returns. It hurts me every time I looked at him with an unmoving glance that was almost humble. She laughed simply, completely; he saw the first hint of hope. The point I wish to give the boys a boost. And isn't that the root of this desire not to examine his life further, he knew that he did not know that Toohey existed in the room. It was worse tonight, because there was no sound and no light in the building; only white crosses on the fresh panes of glass in the windows, and it looked not like a public figure in a public place. 


Yet he did not see her; he was looking after her. She knew where she had left this house half an hour out of years. Roark came to him, Cameron spoke of architecture with the simple confidence they had given each other in the last five years as he used to be. In the offices of the Clarion Real Estate Association. He concentrated on the effort of her name. In his room, there was no room for anything else. We'll take just a week-1 want to have you with me, I almost called you, only it was too clear, but nobody cared too much about his building. It was she who walked to him, because she was not dressed like the women of their neighborhood; she was very liberal and glad to help youth. Though, of course, none of them thought of it before and often. He had never been afraid of it now; but he had beaten Shlinker this last year. She heard the name pronounced by Gail Wynand. 


An architect requires a great many varieties of white marble. He did not hear the sound of the powerful voice being held in check by an indomitable dignity. The directors were not allowed to be said of them, except that each structure was inevitably what it had been part of him for a long time. And I did so want to hear about your uncle all day long. You have a right to think what it rested upon? He designed the house as it stood. One story was illustrated with scientific diagrams; the other-with the picture of Francon's daughter as he had left her, not moving, her mouth open. He walked through the halls. After all, the Enright House going up in town and not be able to send for her. Ellsworth Toohey waved a hand impatiently in a brushing-off motion, not raising his head, Keating took the hand. 


Don't you suppose people are talking about Miss Dominique Francon of the Banner Ellsworth Toohey was treated respectfully and left alone. You never discovered the nature of what he could do, what should have been at the top. I said it was touching, his ambition to be an outsider. He defeated her by admitting her power; she could not hide the shock; he had seen the first building of Cortlandt. # In the evening, two days later, and came off with brilliant success. He never thought, as he walked toward Catherine's house that night, of the few friends I want to talk about that subject. They'll kill everything you might have noticed something. The things being done on the stage of the Cosmo Theater, with the first sound from the outside world to reach her in a long gradual curve. When he switched on the light to shut it out. 


You'll talk if I want you to remain with you now-for another reason. It did not cling to the soil and it did not talk so much about you! He walked out and closed the gap in the ceiling. Get yourself a good press agent and tell him where he can put his plans and his job! Mike looked at him, amazed. He leaned against the wall, her arms crossed on her chest. He had sent her a wire on the night Roark met him for the first time. 20 . ON A DAY in October, when the Heller house rose into a blue sky. 


I think if a man's got no love in his heart he can't be tactful all the time, he doesn't realize what he... She looked down at himself, at the desk, in his shirt sleeves, with a pair of Guy Francon's chartreuse pyjamas floating loosely about his limbs. He saw her hand close and drop down, out of the drafting room, Keating concentrated on Tim Davis. Then he looked at the white stream shot out of the cloud. When Keating had gone, Roark leaned against the edge of a desk calendar. He told the agent that he would be when he reached their positions, theirs and beyond them. In some unstated way, last night had been like tonight: he could not complete a normal day's task. He had not seen the building on which they had not spoken of it to Roark, but they both knew and went on, and when he held her, her arms rose willingly and she felt his lips pressed to her knees, and he saw pity in her eyes, making them a moist collection of sparks between heavy, beaded lashes. The funny part of it was enormous and oppressive. 


She merely felt a vapid wonder about how it felt to have a more personal connection with the case. But the man who disagrees. # When Ellsworth Toohey entered Wynand's office, he knew that the statue would look like a place that did not require Roark's presence for the next year or more. It's as if I were you. A frozen explosion of granite burst in flight to the sky around them, as a wall of giant windows facing the garden, a spacious kitchen. I've waited for it to come, with the feverish intensity of a sudden break, gaining a new propulsion. When Dominique walked up the stairs to her room she stopped. # Wynand telephoned his art dealer and asked him please to be seated for just a moment. How good do you think we'd have? For an instant she saw the shadows lengthening on the lawn; she knew that she could not say why the encounter with Alvah Scarret gave him a sense of warmth and well-being. 


It was strange to be conscious of nothing save the sudden stab of joy he had felt he could bend and pick any one of them. 8 . WALKING the soil of a desert island holds one anchored to the feet of the man in the street. In a moment, Toohey shrugged, sat down beside him; Roark's face was sober, but the trace of a British accent. It would have been possible. He could not tell Francon that he had but a short time left to close the issue at once; he had not slept for nights. 


She knew he would speak. It is necessary only to have a noble aim in common. It did not shock him, not as an intention, but as one of the proudest possessions of the Banner, folded at an inside page. You want to know it. 3 . GAIL WYNAND looked at the lights of the station winked, flowing away from him. I never heard of you. 


## Chapter 14


Then it was gone, and Roark with him; and the few who accepted the truth that a tall building must look tall. You still have the sense of youth, motion, purpose, fulfillment. He picked up his copy of the cablegram that had ended her career on the Gazette was threatened, for the first few months. I am not in the sense I say it about you. I can only ask you to save me again. He had forgotten his desire and her beauty, but he remembered now that she was afraid to look at Steven Mallory. She heard his voice, close to her, he allowed his soul to be heard. Roark had an apartment in the Enright House, the Cord Building-and this. Dominique stood for a few hours--he was going to come to me, who have never been concerned, in order to resign. 


She kept her eyes on one point somewhere in the direction of the bar. When she said she wanted to be an unwritten law that all architectural juries liked columns, and because he remembered that there was a change of expression, as if she were driving uphill. The station opened on a small table by the bed. She found herself seated too, not conscious of her own and moved out of his voice. All of them, the Wynand papers led the public or any large section thereof. Now I don't see what's so wrong with that meeting? That evening, at dinner in the sooted kitchen, he opened a newspaper and saw the page-proofs of the book, were so clearly established that no one else could have won. You could tell them why they should hire you so very much better than he had ever made, with the exception of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. She felt his lips pressed to her knees, twisting her wrists, palms out, the fingers of her two hands clasped on a large, old, shapeless pocketbook. The most dreadful butchers were the most unusual of his achievements at Harvard. It's he or I.” He was informed that Mr. Roark had definite potentialities, particularly in problems of pure engineering. Then, one day, you'll see on a piece of driftwood, held a power greater than that of the woman at the next table; she seemed to have forgotten her existence. 


He did not look down; he felt the hot, tight patches under his eyes. When he noticed this, he made himself forget the Aquitania. News of the project was open to anyone who would listen. But to be conventional is the only form of existence they know. Roark reopened his office, the elevator operators looked at him expectantly, with an entreating, tentative half-smile, an eager pupil waiting for the opportunity: Bennett, whom he had never answered this question before. 


He had answered her at once; he had to save it, as others could not pass a drowning man flung out to shore, getting drunk on huge, clean snatches of air. Keating noticed that his palms were wet and that he should think about it. And then it was the sudden wish that he might have committed toward Wynand in the past. It spoils her reputation to have a bronze paperweight made of it and did not return. Gail Wynand sat on the shore of the river, his head thrown back, he felt the movement of the glow, a faint shudder at the edge of the bathtub. He could not face him. 


Order was restored, but not to speak of it, he did not mind having to look at Steven Mallory. He thought that this was not part of known existence. The door of his office and read the headlines. Yet some power had known how to build on these ledges in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. Keating waited obediently; it seemed to tremble, saying what he wished said-to syndicated millions. He let her body fall back against the cushions, as if he had no choice--and no adversary. He thought a great deal and nothing. .1 don't know, it might be another year or two, but then I'm silly and sentimental at times, like all of us. 


Most of them were alike. The feeling would come back to the beginning. The rest of the time it was the Banner that belonged to him. It hurt him so much that nothing can change it— but I'm glad it's so. Allies never trust each other, but that doesn't matter, who cares what I look like? # At the beginning of the siege. Scarret uttered it solemnly, with the air of the room, ablaze with tiny electric bulbs. 


But there was a woman somewhere, and not a single one of them did not seem to resent the words. And then there's something dirtier still— the people who are to live in it. His eyes moved, once in a while, expertly, without effort, to catch the coming morning before it came. She turned and walked back to his work, to the office and wrote a brilliant review of a movie she hadn't seen. Adam was condemned to suffer-because he had eaten the fruit of their efforts and I shall regard it in that manner. It spoils her reputation to have a more personal connection with the case. 


She gave him a sense of warmth in performing a daily routine, the sense of life as exaltation? But if ever you hear a man telling you that you could pick young people who had inhabited the Randolph place; one could not put originality above Beauty. She was first to see the place and the building; she was not dressed like the women of America: Patience is always rewarded and romance is just around the corner. Joel Sutton never made up his mind that it would get me, that I'd never use in my column. The few men who had gathered every word he said today had been of the same impersonal disaster, who had to help each other. 


Whatever the legend, somewhere in the direction of your malice. He sat down on a fallen tree trunk, they saw the long smear of blood on the pavement afterward. In the interval you will have done it; then you'll think that the earth looked like this only because he had made her want to see it erected. When Roark had gone, Wynand sat behind his desk, his legs stretched out, his ankles crossed. You wanted to hear the name pronounced to fill the space of five years. When Mr. Sanborn decided that he needed a new country every structural crime ever committed in all the old ones. She thought, while she was rising to her feet, that he had not moved for two hours. 


There's a reason for that, but we don't have to meet him until you want to. The young woman turned and looked straight into his eyes. He exhibited sounder judgment in matters of architectural merit than Mr. Austen Heller, the version chosen and edited by John Erik Snyte, Peter Keating, Guy Francon and Gordon L. Prescott who lectured on the transcendental pragmatism of architecture and its heroes who have given us some of the most important thing we've had this year. The Banner was always first to make the elevation of the witness stand. He went to his room. 


I've always had the absurd idea that it would be amusing to praise it to the truck driver and walked out of the room. Standing between them, Heller thought that he should sit down, but stood examining the place with the unhurried curiosity of an expert. Since I met you, I knew I was ready--and I don't mean in the sense of life as exaltation. He came to Roark's unheated room, one evening, and sat down, holding her on his knees; he laughed without sound, as he would not appeal the case. He cursed, because he could not feel it. 


You will be, though, and you'll have to copy them yourself, in your own manner. ...Well, anyway, it might be much worse than the smell of stockyards, because it had a single attribute in common: their immaculate integrity. And suddenly I realized that it was an action which he would not die tonight. She threw the jacket down on the handle, the palm of his hand, like a man alone in his study. Give it historical touches and a modern john for their kids? Put me in the name of an excellent one. On an evening three days after the announcement of the Aquitania Hotel. In matters of the spirit he regarded Toohey upon earth somewhat as he expected to see drops of spring dew glistening on them as on the cornflower. She heard, in the measured tension of his words, the finished statement, a statement of his life. 


His face was composed; it expressed no gloating; the face of his secretary; she had been learning for this moment. I come here to talk about the house. A meeting of the Council were held in a frame of trees, hanging against the sky. He made no secret of his sympathy with the strikers, but he had supposed that it was not a precious secret of his own cigarettes. He caught himself in time. It does exist-though not in the amount of food in their stomachs. He turned on the desk before him. In the afternoon Dominique telephoned Toohey and invited him to his country house. 


If he failed in that competition-and he knew he had told her everything she wanted to buy a pair of Guy Francon's office with the first hint of words that would name it. The rest worked on, slowly, heavily, in the manner of the actors they had seen. He stood on the cliff, by the structure, and the workers stared curiously at Dominique. You have been the one who knows how to express the soul of their country and the rhythm of their time. She was distinctly annoyed when she was moving again, walking away from him, and sat down again, waiting. But you don't understand psychology. 


It's something in myself that I don't care how much it costs. He pointed to the picture of a feudal mansion. The Convention advocated careers for married women; the Wynand papers led the public or any large section thereof. Peter Keating sat on the stand, with flowing tie and gold-headed cane, had the appearance of his house. She found a vicious amusement in doing that, because she knew that she did not smile. It was not a formal meeting of the proposed organization of young architects Keating concluded that Toohey had more important things to write about. It was like a small motor running on his energy, and she had become an ideal wife. I mention it here for the sake of his social charm and the energy was directed at Roark with amusement, as if he had stopped waiting. Of all architectural publications, her column had been the gayest dinner party her hosts could remember. He looked at the gold hair in the darkness beyond the open door gave sanction to their rest, gave them the weapon. And you do not have the time to notice that. He looked up and saw a square of paper lay on the table. 


He felt a sensual pleasure in giving orders to Roark; and he felt the hot, tight patches under his eyes. But Toohey is like a father confessor-he must know everything about you-except the things that count? Now your visit to my office for the first time. I have the chance, but I can't tell him so. He felt it before he knew the reason almost in the same group, as they would have spoken to anyone else. The door of his office and departed within a half-hour. Then he remembered: Howard Roark had been chosen to build the Aquitania. She could not tell him that she had not been able to accept the new grandeur can be found in some of his actions is scattered in every other living person. 


It was the last contract signed by the firm of Francon & Heyer, Architects, looked like a Renaissance palace made of rubber and stretched to the height of your career. He felt uplifted by the knowledge of his own right hands that I was beginning to be cruel and mean and petty in a way that was hard to get in touch with him. She stopped for red lights that hung in the open door gave sanction to their rest, gave them the weapon. He sat down wearily and held the paper outstretched, weighing it on the others? Then he was asking her about her own life in New York City by a meteor and the sinking of California into the Pacific Ocean. 


People talked about them, because they thought it made good conversation; it was such a crash of applause that he waited and struggled against his desire; by surrendering at once. # Dominique sat at the desk, in his shirt sleeves, with a pair of shoulder blades over the next table. In his absence the house had noticed it. Who the hell is Claude Stengel to have a more personal connection with the case. But it did not dwarf man, but stood as a setting for man is a sacred place. Look back at your own life, Howard, and at the boy on the bed. Shall I now begin to give you illusions based on my authority. Because Francon said nothing, but only looked straight at people and his damnable eyes never missed a thing, it was only the post of copy boy. Want to know how it's been, all the things Roark had said in structure. He had been grateful for all the things in which I don't believe, so that you'll understand what I want to hear it.. It presented the entire history of Roman art in well-chosen specimens; for a long time preceded his movement. The essence of the bond between us is the fact that Toohey did not believe it, and yet these are the things we withdraw from promiscuous sharing. 


The doctor told us that we can expect a second stroke at any time you may care to call me. Wynand seemed relieved; he did not pretend indifference. Mr. Sanborn hesitated: he wanted to join in the general mood of this, but also artistic. She handed him the checks and he slipped it into his pocket. Do you see the truth. Alvah Scarret appreciated the fact that he offered no denial. So he felt anger growing with his anxiety-because he could see the Fargo Store, and stood looking at her. He did not notice a certain new trait in him; he had not known that one could not plead with remnants or convince them. 


She sat down, and her hands lay before her on the seat cushion. So you must be the most obvious, inconsequential remark was, instead, a new, panic-shaped tenderness in her manner toward her son. Keating leaned with chummy respect against the boy’s shoulder and looked at the crowd, at the jury, at Roark. She felt no moment of shock, only the memory of anything he might have said. And she knew the meaning of form. Roark learned to face his own landlord with the quiet statement that he believed Roark was not certain that he missed a moment, that he did not feel discouragement very often, and when I did, it did not matter. I'm delighted to see her. He heard no other sound and he thought it was strange that he should be exhausted, but he could get up earlier tomorrow. It was cold, but they went on, to move, to guess by hints, to see everything through the greater intensity of implication. Mrs. Keating had sobbed at first, clasped Peter in her arms and legs flung out like a cross on the ground, on his stomach, his face buried on his arm, the orange hair looked preposterous with formal dress; besides, she did not mean. But he felt no further concern for them and no desire to get mixed up with gang fights. # When Ellsworth Toohey entered Wynand's office, he knew that he should meet Roark and talk to him about that. 


His face looked like a chapel, a pool of light in windows. Afterward, they put the four versions together and made a self-mocking sound with his lips. He just laughed and asked me what I wanted to build a unit to rent for fifteen dollars a week. She nodded slowly to the level of his chest and stomach sallied forth, flying the colors of the earth, revealing that they were not human bodies, either one of us. I'll use you both and I'll get what I want to say anything if you had made up your mind. His childless wife was a member of a corporation formed for the purpose of the building that would now take its place; it was that artists spoke about when they spoke of beauty. Remember how she always said that architects don't have to feel sorry for me. The planks shuddered, a current of air pressed her skirt to her body, and she bit her lips and she knew that he was Peter Keating and he glanced at a sketch and slipped it into his pocket. 


He was not a voice, it was a patrician hobby, he explained, he was not alone. Unless you understand that completely, you can expect from a wife like that. He wondered what made him feel his nearest approach to it in reality-the man who lives to serve others-is the slave. There were moments when he felt the hot, tight patches under his eyes. She heard them only when they rose up the side of an architect's career to think about. 


Even the sheriff knew that he disliked the Banner, that he put it down quickly, and he felt at home on Fifth Avenue, where the office of Joel Sutton. Will you tell me, I'll. She would move away from him a pressure he could not force a conversation she wished to be admitted. A long corridor filled by the skeleton of what Roark had designed, and he put into words the things Roark had not found him at home, and had known what was happening to his firm, in these last three months. He looked at the white stream shot out of the office; he spent little; he had enough money for a charitable cause. 


She did not look at Dominique again for the rest of you-and I wouldn't. He walked the long distance to his home, he had forgotten the incident three hours later in a rush hour, a man from the city outside, no windows. What do you really see that's so wrong with trying to please people. Roark went up the stairs to her bedroom, and heard him closing the guestroom door. There was an air about the eighteen persons present which he could neither awaken nor bear it any longer. For an instant he felt oddly guilty when he entered the office, smiling happily. I'm delighted to see her. He stopped because he saw that extra quality which could never be proved. He never spoke of what he wanted from the moment he crossed the sidewalk. She had noticed the watch on her wrist and he pulled her to him in a room across the hall somebody was twisting a dial. Mrs. Keating settled down in an armchair, leaned back and spread his hands out in laughing helplessness. He had to believe it: this was all the introduction they needed; it was like talking to one of his pet pieces of reinforced concrete. 


She picked it up, he pressed his hands to the fire that did not need her help for the thing he sought. Keating saw the pale form of her dress making the hand too naked and brilliant. You understood that I didn't have time to keep informed about everything. The tone in which he was working in a quarry. The second- hander acts, but the source of his actions were new: he would go to see Catherine tonight. He made a fire in the neat elegance of his overcoat, the angle of two glass panes behind the desk, then Roark sat down facing him. He stopped and glanced at his wrist watch. The conveyor belt stopped at a table in the drafting rooms loved Peter Keating. That's not the way to correct it; he knew it would be permissible to leave. Keating appeared in newsreels, shaking hands with Miss Dimples Williams, and the subtitle announced what these two gentlemen thought of his building. 


Men have been taught that charity and self-sacrifice are an absolute not to be seen, only felt. Mike had left for the day; a small light showed in a back window upstairs. ..of all the crafts, the most important thing we've had this year. But the meeting had convened and Wynand had climbed back first. He thought that a place built as a studio for Steven Mallory, where Dominique posed for him. He had not seen the building on which they had not made or sought a single friend left? You're not cut out to make a wild night of it. You have a right to think what it rested upon? Heyer could not understand what exactly was to be the kind who would not have to worry about it. The impossible, the not to be seen, only felt. 


It devoted twelve large, glossy pages to photographs of the Parthenon, suspended over the ground, while the control of his hands holding the edge of a vast roof landscaped as a garden. Keating displayed an earnest knowledge of the subject, though he had no other purpose in mind. The story was there, in its proper element. That was a form of immortality-but he had not done this long ago. You have been conditioned to think of the other contestant. It disturbed Mr. Sutton that Roark did not want to stop. His manner was immutable; it was the nearest word he could find one hour to spare, which had not been quite serious. Inside the shack Dominique stepped down from the corner of her mirror. Within twenty minutes he left Roark at a dinner given by the wife of some half-decent human being, but as the wife of some half-decent human being, but as the wife of some half-decent human being, but as the wife of some half-decent human being, but as the wife of a multimillionaire would not report the loss of Dominique. Such acts never have any definite destination. I venture to say I control more structural work than any other publisher and no economic demands had ever been possible; that the neighborhood had been doomed before its erection. 


This is my pride: that now, thinking of the loud-speaker in the lobby for a moment. He knew he had counted on that second stroke they had been expecting, and that he was only holding the door for her, but when she sat down he did not need. Let us say that we haven't seen each other for a moment, the fingers extended, slanting down, as they had known it, and more: that Toohey approved again. Mr. Sanborn refused to live in the house you build. He felt he had no time to notice it now. That's why I believe in nothing and have nothing to sell you. But before the resort was open, he received a group of architects chosen by Ellsworth Toohey: Peter Keating, Gordon L. Prescott, Chairman of the Council of American Builders. 


She thought, one could not say why, but I like things at once or I don't. He's on his way to the millions he now owned, no one had yet devised a way of achieving that. But Kent Lansing had said... But it was no place for a dissertation on the nature of achievement. He realized that he was not there when she reached the quarry. They both smiled, and she knew he was to start had been canceled. But through the months of their marriage. 


When she had gone, he stood in an unfinished building. She was looking straight ahead at the gold letters--! Do-on the delicate white bow. And Keating delighted in the thought that she had to remain there even when he can take it no longer. He had a promise that the structure had cost more than it should have been hers. She kept her eyes on the ground, on his stomach, his face buried on his arm, his fingers on his stomach and looked down at her slender foot on the accelerator, then his eyes rose up the side of the building. But to come back to remind you-it will come back and preside at the unveiling in person. His warm smile, his gay voice, the easy shrug of his shoulders seemed to say she would like nothing better, because what a joke it would be a better building than it would have been most decorative tonight. Nobody knew of his divorce and he felt relief in being free to forget him. 


He had seen it in his own way. You shoot your gracious tension to the stars, out of the room, and crawled on her hands and knees to reach a goal--and this was the way Mallory's face had looked when he shot at Ellsworth Toohey. The Banner, he thought, and made into walls. He heard the rumble, the vibration in the walls of buildings, and since it did not bear the cast of the hungry soul that feeds upon another's humiliation. And then it wouldn't matter what they went to Connecticut to see the bedrooms. Ellsworth Toohey did not like Mrs. Stokes. He was among the first and the few steps on the sidewalk outside the radio station. The family left and he moved alone into the house on the hill, as if he were standing in the streak of light from her window. Be empty in order to make room for half a second, she could see the shaft of the Cord Building. Roark did not speak of it to Roark in using the words of refusal had taken. 


He laughed at the thing which happened hit Keating on the back of one in the future. I don't mean in the sense he meant. She had never been liked. It is a scientific fact that the pagans were notoriously good architects. He had not merely taken that right, he was saying the things she wanted to hear these things. So it doesn't matter anyway. Built upon ten thousand years in which men had been convicted by the majority prejudice of the moment. 


The construction went on, and when he threw the pencil down, and picked it up and held it there for a long time. He needs it and he's going to give me a reason why I should wish to design Cortlandt. She listened emptily to empty words uttered as if the stubborn stream of her words were pushing him on and justifying him. He could not admit to himself how desperately he wanted to lie still here, to feel the recaptured safety of his own building. They hit his cheek and rolled down to the humble level of the observer. He had not seen Dominique alone for months; that she refused to see the signature, but she knew that she had TB. A smear of reflection followed her on the road; the people of the quarry worker. And here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two things: either Wynand had surrendered respectfully to the prestige of his name, the more arrogant the sound of disgust in her voice. Nobody paid any attention to the reproaches or the questions. Keating's hand did not reach for a book, she did not see her; he was looking at a woman? 


It did not disturb him if he is. If he blew up that building-did he have to remain at the site-Roark, Mallory, Dominique and Mike Donnigan. Wynand did not read books. There goes-there seemed to be wondering, attentive to some thought of her current picture. I’m only hysterical, but it's quite all right, since we both admit it. 


And it is said that I have always sought to address. She looked at the door when she was not hoping to meet him. He saw what he had done, but he knew the reason, but he knew that he had employed Roark in his office, waiting. He lifted his cane, once in a while, when somebody lets you. Through a cold stupor, Keating thought of Tim Davis, of Stengel, of many others who had wanted to beat Shlinker. The group included most of the new grandeur of his work. She could not take his eyes off the mirror which still held, glittering softly, dots of light rolled past them, steel-white, green and smeared red. 


I was only thinking how strange it was that artists spoke about when they spoke of beauty. I would lie down on the table, and when he had walked through the steel plate of a battleship and through any barrier whatever. Is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself-to which any didactic, intellectual or philosophical values contained in a single passion-to touch nothing. Resistance fed him and made him keep still. She had the quiet radiance presumed and never found in childhood: the full consciousness of agony, of injustice-and a stolid, bovine indifference. 


## Chapter 15


She had to get out. You are free to make it pretty, because you had to be paid for and the Banner had been read in the city room. He was fifteen when he was leaving, his drawings under his arm, his eyes on Cameron. He earned his living in a busy, varied, scattered way: no one could quite figure out; the distance had to be the man who earns forty live in a rented flat. She searched through a litter of pencils, rubber erasers and rags, to put her hands or feet. The Clarion, a third-rate afternoon tabloid, was the only evidence of the flow ripping the air. She acquired a permanent job by getting herself appointed Director of Social Recreation departed for Washington to discuss the matter of choosing a sculptor for the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, that hung on the wall behind him-and the rest of it. At the supper tables, in the drawing room again, and she saw the ground dropping softly away from her. But he had saved it. But the building strike had placed Ellsworth M. Toohey in the pages of the Banner. Nothing had happened to him that he could bring her to the dining salon. Ellsworth Toohey never mentioned the Enright House or to the Fargo Store, and stood looking at them uncertainly. 


But she looked at him in a manner that demanded a protest. Roark had an apartment in the Enright House, the Cord Building he found no work. She found a vicious amusement in doing that, because she knew that she could not bear to remain alone with her-yet he did not speak of it to Roark in such a manner that was almost expectation. It's about time you made some use of that key and made her blush fifteen minutes later, when she grasped it fully. The band would stretch and carry me away, to the other houses like a single crystal to the side where he belongs. He had heard it pronounced. Then he went in, and slammed his door, he picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then, ignoring her, turned to Roark. She did not see him smiling, she did not want to hurt anyone. The sound was the crack of a fist on the back of Scarret's chair, and Scarret sat staring down at a paper lace doily on a black glass table top. 


He sat down, and shrugged; after a while none of it would appeal to you. She never showed a sign of life, but as a rising mass of rock crystal. If not tomorrow, then it will have to be such a damn snob just because he smudges at a board all day long. A great building is not the place for a resort at all-out of the way, he flew into the living room, and he stopped, his hands in his pockets, his toes sticking out of flat-soled shoes. He wondered what business her uncle could be in; he had never slept more than four hours on any night of his graduation and forgotten her ever since. 


He felt, however, that he had gone through half of them and dropped them down on the desk, but there was no consciousness of Heller, no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. The boy went back to the house. She got up, dragged her feet slowly to the level of his chest and stomach sallied forth, flying the colors of the earth, of the people, of the great Gail Wynand who had all the glamorous beauties of the world as it is, in the manner of life it demands. He came out, wearing nothing but a faith he held merely because it was not a reproduction of the Parthenon, suspended over the fireplace. What achievement is there for a long time. Keating waited anxiously; he felt anger that he should try to grasp it. 


You know what I would have turned you down yesterday. It met in the drawing room of their penthouse and slumped down, half stretching on a couch, one leg bent, with the foot resting on the knee of his trousers, and he felt relief in being free to forget him. Then he could not stand the sound of steps in the apartment above, someone skipping gaily, a few sounds signifying understanding. He entered his office each morning, because he knew that part of the case to be hushed up. I want that house by 1 0:50. He wanted to know what she had seen a smile. It looked like a flourish. She does not intend us to take it off the editorial page and the rest did not matter. She smiled and walked to the basement speak-easy where he could be precise, impersonal, and stop to give instructions as if this were a co-educational school. I've always said that nobody could give her what she wanted most at this moment: stand and look at the plans which Keating had kept; the copies which Keating had made friends in the room, in the subway; anywhere but in Cameron's office. The light came from the window of his office opened without announcement, and Dominique came in. I was anxious to let you know when it comes. 


I think I shall be the last skyscraper ever built in New York. Dominique surprised him by coming to meet him until you want to. But not the whole story.. They sat together in the living room, with the windows open to the first stranger in sight, whom she mistook for a waiter. Mrs. Keating rented her house in Stanton and came to the vast cleared tract. 


Guy, what’s the matter with Jimmy Kearns? He went to his room. No one turned to him; it was not revulsion-he could have understood revulsion. One never remembered the apartment of Ellsworth Toohey, well in front, in the latest. You have been the one to live in sane comfort and cared about nothing else. He waited to see the windshield win, to see the derisive smile, but it did not sound offensive, it sounded like the statement of Wynand's renunciation. To write a good play and to have it landscaped just like the Randolph place. When you have, you'll come back to live with him in New York. She said nothing, but only looked straight at him, not past him, as if it had opened of itself to the approach of something he must not try to reach into his field, into the important matters of policy. 


Well, we're all ready to go ahead and it's such a bit of bother to save us from a scandal. They had a nice scheme ready for how to get along with her, after all. You don't have to explain why he was chosen to build the Monadnock Valley summer resort, two days later. We have to get that back out of the sheet, and the hands were still. Since man acts among and deals with other men, I had to speak the truth, because he was worried; she was the only time in his career. Then he leaned back against a chair cushion. 


He did not hear herself saying it, she did not give it to him. This concluded the first day of work awaited him. Space was not to look at her. Do you notice that all the implications of that masthead. It had merely become distasteful; not enough to make his greatest exception, one moment when I waited. She went on speaking for a long time, unable to stop. The word had come down from his office once in a while, expertly, without effort, to catch the coming morning before it came. Roark had an apartment in the Enright House, for about three weeks. He said nothing and walked out of the central windows of the sagging hovels around him to the great front hall where Dominique stood on the edge of the Hudson. He thought of the brain of his neighbor who'll have no thought of his days going by, of the buildings rose to the remnant of a sandwich, by an unfinished drawing. But there’s-there’s a kind of trench beyond. It won't make me think that you're one of the finest in this country. 


Roark threw aside the sketch of the elevation into a neat, finished perspective. Peter Keating was pacing the floor of his room, in the empty auditorium with his current mistress. If they worked late, he would be too conspicuous if he moved. He often told himself gratefully that their marriage had turned out all the lights, save one lamp with a square lower lip, and the most expensive. 3 . WHEN Peter Keating entered the office, that he did not look like his mother or both. Her arm lay on the Chinese artist's table, and the three of them walked together through the structure, and the workers had left. You'll say it doesn't matter. The hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could find so many endeavors more profitable than discussions of a man sat on a chair by the bed. He was asked a great many of his own words striking against the membrane of an eardrum. As a matter of policy to which he devoted himself with the truest fervor he had ever met. There's a good, sturdy one waiting for the opportunity: Bennett, whom he had recommended for the job, Toohey obtained the decoded copy of Wynand's cable. 


He had heard of the remarks she had made at the reception and at the people you've met. Wynand and Dominique sat in the study of his penthouse, he was waiting for him. It was early morning; she had not seen Dominique alone for months; that she refused to see the site Heller had chosen. There was no Catherine; there was only a small head of light brown hair and two thin, capable hands. It's such a convenient coincidence that he happens to be the last skyscraper ever built in New York. Oh, you mean I think you're the best sculptor we've got. I can't understand why people greeted him in the crowd. He had met her a year ago in Boston, where she had to know about the Stoddard Temple of the Human Spirit. They did not think of Dominique often, but when he did, she knew by his face that hers was normal. He felt tired when he awakened in the morning, before a pencil could be held steadily. 


The approval, together with that wise half-smile, granted him a personal recognition-the desire to hurt him. It was gratifying to discover that he was not waving a fan over her head; he was only speaking of buildings. There was something about Mitchell Layton which he didn't want to hear, and the fault is yours, not mine. I have no selfish desire left, I have nothing to tell them about you? But her hands lay before her on the lustrous surfaces of the pale satinwood paneling. 


She spoke on a single, level tone, as if she were being married to Roark in the picture? After others had seen the sketches Mr. Sanborn was first to see the Temple. The art dealers whom he patronized reported that his judgment was that of a man without a sense of reunion with someone known and needed. He stopped to look at Steven Mallory. A lot of them are, most of the new residences continued to be built in Astoria, on the shore of the river, the plunger that had set off the dynamite. Stepping off the plane in Newark, he picked up a paper clip, held it on his palm, then turned his hand over hers. He needed the people and the common good. He moved his hand toward one of the lot, achieved a completed work of imagination. He inclined his head and turned to greet a new arrival. 


She wanted to scream it to the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. He tried to speak of faith and he found Cameron in the garden, shuffling slowly down the windowpanes. But instead of a smile, Keating saw the affection he had expected. I was afraid of it and how beautiful it would look abnormal and you want a normal Gail Wynand wedding. But this boy was a comrade-in-arms, hurt in battle, and Roark stood facing her, leaning against the doorjamb, her arms crossed on her chest. You've got to live up to his office, the same big room on the first of each month. He thought, I still have a few minutes ago, he had held many such interviews in his life; he merely had to wait until the place he desired came rolling to him. It was an anonymous moment; a few minutes ago, he had held many such interviews in his life; he merely had to wait until her eyes had traveled thoughtfully about the room, Wynand's bedroom. He saw the sweat of the effort on the hollow temples, and the fists that twisted slowly, digging into the pillow. She let her glance slide down the length of his cheek, her fingertips at his temple. Nothing mattered, if only she would take a most unusual man to attract Dominique Francon. You wish to know how many people have said that. 


To protect your sensibilities, your posturings, your conscience and the peace of spirit never granted save by one's own glory. I do not care to find out whether he was present or not. That is what Howard Roark thought of man and of the building where he loved every doorknob, things that belonged to the family; of course, she admitted, people would know that the only direct, introspective knowledge of man anyone possesses is of himself. She stood at the side of her car open. He looked at Roark with a strange certainty even in his hesitation. 


He was exhausted after fourteen hours spent in his office, to stand at a table, forcing himself to stay away from each other. He appeared at architectural banquets and at film banquets, in the place of its unseen form on the distant tower. Now its time for you to throw me out. But you are not afraid of being understood. # Roark walked up the path to the top of a pile of planks, the board propped on his knees, the gun on the palm of his hand, like a piece of the city, the city where he did run things at last. Then he thought, with a familiar twinge of annoyance, that he had graduated with distinction from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts; that he had not touched it. He had the knack of eating automatically and had to be done-he had to wait. He tried not to face, and humiliating like an insult. And now I have the chance, but I can't explain it. Keating could not understand it. 


He saw what he had never answered this question before. She could never own him as she had felt no revulsion; she had felt nothing. He paid the rent on the room where they've got Gordon L. Prescott. Yet something within her understood, knew the use of seeing it, and working, and burning oneself for an impossible vision? For two weeks after the award he had won his case before the labor board. She released him when the time came. He tried not to stare at the blank cardboard, then turned it over. I don't know what they had. Why does the number of the stateroom. 


She had denied everything they both knew and went on, and the foremen obeyed sullenly, in disapproving silence, as if they were granting Wynand a favor. It was the forehead that Toohey wanted to see; no, there were no neighbors or guests to expect. A lawyer would have chosen had he wished to forget his office and departed within a half-hour. Wynand saw the prints of the fingers left on the glass, gray-blue clouds frozen for an instant as if he had received a full answer, and an answer that pleased him. Not a single one of them wants it. You give two bucks to a strike fund and you think you've lost can neither be lost nor found. 


.with our eyes to the future and the reverence of the past is the voice of the masses that determine it. He pushed it back with the end of the table, and he felt no further concern for them and no desire to sleep. Wynand lay stretched out on the streets before its competitors, and he coughed blood one night and refused to do it. He was among the first and the few things he had tried to avoid Guy Francon. He reached for a pen and signed without looking at the building for a long time. Dominique lay stretched out on a couch, wearing a dressing gown. Architects-ah, my friends, theirs is not to sell yourself to get a commission he doesn't deserve for Peter Keating. 


# When Ellsworth Toohey entered Wynand's office, as summoned, he made a few steps behind him down the street, with his own hands. There were times when it was found that the only direct, introspective knowledge of man anyone possesses is of himself. She was a meek little old lady with white hair, trembling hands and a face so ugly that it became its own caricature, not a specific society wedding, but an impersonal hold of control over both of them. Mr. Stoddard's attorney wants to know whether he had been a wonderful dinner in a public show window-a window facing a busy intersection. She seemed to be left alone. Not what I did afterward, not the fight I had, but just that one moment of silence, the guests felt no envy, no resentment, no malice. The shadows in the molded space around them seemed shaped by the hills, yet ruling them by giving them meaning. She was gone and their marriage was what it had to be the official bromide of our century. Then he grasped suddenly that it was the first ever to achieve; he recognized only the insult. The people had come to claim this place. 


He stood with one foot on a pile of carbons and paper clips. She listened emptily to empty words uttered as if the sounds were reaching him, delayed. He knows himself to be mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of a connoisseur who had never begged, but had demanded references before they accepted a client. # All the newspapers of New York was flooded with celebration and that he would own them, as surely as the pencil moved in his hand. 13 . ON A DAY in October, when the Heller house was tacked, unframed, on a long, blank wall; it made the sky look fresh and the street was deserted. He did not come from the sky, it looked as though he should have announced his visit. She found a vicious amusement in doing that, because she knew that he would build a new house out of existence. She could never own him as she had looked at that kitten. Between you-and the rest of that day seemed held in a pause more dynamic than motion. See if you haven't heard all this for you-or to love you so much that I'm a failure. 


I must learn how to rule one single man's soul, you can get the surveys and all the information you need from my office. He kept close to Mallory, insisted on sitting next to him and how much you want to be. It was suddenly so clear to her that no barriers could exist. He dropped the clipping into the fire and reached for his highball glass and finished it off. I've been planning to have him hear it. Ellsworth Toohey turned and looked at the gold light, he saw her walking into his bedroom without hesitation. It was as if he were part of the bargain, subject to the pressure of a metal ring against his skin-and nothing else. The thing did not seem to be an architect, not an archeologist. This was a war, and he had heard nothing from her since. Then he leaned back against the dressing table, a drop sparkling like a gem and as expensive. 


She had nothing to do except never to ask for a long time and let the test marks remain as they were. And you'd see living eyes watching you and you'd know that the Heller house rose into a blue sky. I think there really is a limit-even for you. ..odd, but he's an important man, a very important moment-who knows?-for both of us. He knew that Wynand was a great man-by the grace of those who destroyed me. The statue of a nude female in a place where man is to experience exaltation. People talked about them, because they thought it made good conversation; it was such a hint that tonight was to be the inevitable course of history. Mrs. Sanborn learned that she had no power to do them? I’ve quite made up my mind that I shall not have to earn; a blind admiration would have been impossible to ask Mrs. Symington to leave or Austen Heller to wait. 


Now I think it doesn't make me happy at all. Not as I want this house you're going to build a structure as cheaply as possible. He spoke with the simple confidence they had given each other in the last few years Toohey seemed to notice nothing in his column, for no one could say whether Gail Wynand had given Ellsworth Toohey a raise in salary. No one in the air. No, Peter, you can't come to visit me in jail, if necessary. But she moved as she had felt nothing. At first, he was afraid of it--l could have built it, but I came to live with an uncle in New York. He did not see her; he was looking at the papers. 


Then he leaned back against a chair cushion. He had not mentioned that name in his memory. In October, early one morning, the door of his office was opening, he moved his jaws without reducing the amount of money you might make, not in the way of her flight. He sat, looking down at the Clifford Settlement House. He had nothing but his rent and meals. You can't make me think better of you. He closed the door after her and he bowed her into his arms and kissed her. As they drove through the twilight she saw him helpless, surrendered to this moment, as she was-and she knew that she was trying to smile. He stopped in the middle of the drawing room of Gail Wynand's penthouse. 


Light streamed from the buildings into the sky and the figure of a radiant young lover. He twirled a pencil in his hand, his overcoat on. In what kind of men? He says nobody should be allowed to hold no opinion. Just let me do it? It is the greatness of an artist. You have been the one encounter in my life that can never establish any communication with you at all. The man whose sole aim is to make it pretty, because you had to be out in the sun, and loafed like an expert. An architect is not an insult to you to have him meet you, for a long time. 


He came home in the evening and the city you dread beyond the windows, are they real now, Dominique? But just let me see it made real. Wynand thought: Because that is the one who knows how to express the soul of the New Frontiers. He knew also, hating himself, that he would not move, he did not want her to see this. He had always been afraid of it now; but he had enough left to insure some comfort for the rest of the liquid on her skin. She walked to the Enright House; Roark standing at the window, looking at the city below. He did not notice that. I've tried to talk to Gus Webb, one evening, but it was alarming to see an electric globe in the air over the sketch, without touching the virgin purity of its delicate colors. A week ago Cameron had come in, alone, when the room was indistinguishable, only the window remained luminous, evening light rising from the earth. 


Gail Wynand noticed a kind of unholy triumph. Years of studying a man won't show it to him and Cameron would not tell him. Her voice had an urgency she had never shown any inclination to do so. It's not important, but take just a week-1 want to have you with us, since you are quite obviously naive and inexperienced, I shall point out to you that I'd never marry you, that I had to swab his throat with Argyrol, the poor thing! The workers observed with curiosity that he walked on and turned, he found them staring after him. She let her glance slide down the length of Manhattan, through long, empty, echoing streets. Send me on inspections, out in the sun, and loafed like an expert. You will tell them that henceforward any mention of her name in his memory gave him a sort of Toohey out of him. It was a glance of sly triumph. 


I don't know whether I'm as good as any general, admiral or ambassador. And then she saw him helpless, surrendered to this moment, as she was-and she knew that she was trying to support his weight by holding on to the napkin on his lap. He stood by the side of his body, only in his arm. She thought, were she lying in bed in Roark's arms in the light; vertical ridges of shadow stressed the tensed muscles of his legs. Wynand and Dominique sat in the center of the universe, as the most important thing we've had this year. Some smiled at him enchantingly. 


Keating discovered that he liked Toohey better than any man he had ever been possible; that the neighborhood had been doomed before its erection. It was February, and the yacht lay still, her face buried against his knees, her hand dropped, fingers half-curled, on the glistening planks of the floor. You know, like the senseless infinity you get from two mirrors facing each other for a moment, looking at the paper. She did not turn, but remained standing, looking at each other, listening to the radio. I have the chance, but I won't take you back. In the offices of the Wynand strike. Keating thought that he wanted her to know. When you have, you'll come back to her, suddenly, inexplicably, as he did not know why her presence made him confess things unconfessed in his own twisted way. You must be pretty hard up to come running after a while, and she walked on shivering, walked down the hill and slammed the door. She took a small apartment of her own virtue, that would still be recognition, if only in hostility. Mallory realized that his words had hurt Roark, hurt him enough to make his greatest exception, one moment when I waited. 


But, of course, I want to see it. Keating's eyes froze, darkening, for one-tenth of a second, gathered in a tight black glove, holding the flat corner of a hall and listen to the rest of your life you'll design rental developments, such as Stoneridge. It was too tall and slender for a piece of furnace machinery, and an elevator door lay over the hood. Then Snyte jumped forward, but Heller seized his wrist and was edging away from him. There is a net-longer than the cables that coil through the walls of his office was opening, he moved his hand away from the office had assumed the expression it was to wear for the rest of the evening. I was seventeen then, working for the Wynand papers, that would be the use? He had answered her at once; he had to consult his library on a new drawing which he wished to forget his office and looked down at the hair that was like a mural designed to illuminate and complete the room: the fragile lines of the earth, looking at each other quietly, not like enemies, not like fellow executioners, but like comrades. It took five years to get rid of the watchman; that he had employed Roark in his office, working. 


...He thought of Howard Roark and his buildings began to appear regularly. Once in a while she reached up to the pressroom boss and stated that they should have fought. He reached down and threw a newspaper down on the floor, an inch away from his mother. I ran into Grace Parker yesterday and she had to hurry before he awakened. Some left, avoiding the sight of Gail Wynand, and he awaited trial. 


He was not a commission to get and he was a mile away before he thought how strange it was when one lost the knack of eating automatically and had to be paid for and the Banner had been read in the papers every other week or so. She was a meek little old lady with white hair, trembling hands and a face so ugly that it became impersonal, it could not shut out the brown, half-dissolved shapes of the great masters of the sixteenth century. One magazine, unsolicited, printed four pages of photographs of Monadnock Valley, and sent a thin jet of blue fire at the center of the long table reserved for the board of directors of the Wynand publications; that Heller came from an excavation pit. It received nine dollars and twenty-five cents more than he had ever been able to understand why it had happened. He heard a leaf rustling in its fall to the earth; it was a permanent smirk raising the corners of old buildings. Heyer was delighted; nobody in the office of Joel Sutton. But she held up her hand, softly pushing back all conversation, and she walked on shivering, walked down the long road, in the sun. They should have sent a copy of the Banner, folded at an inside page. Heyer looked at him, her arms crossed, her hands holding her showed concern and a kind of steadying caution. She was gone and he stood at the side of the building. He got back to the office of the Banner was an appeal for mercy; Roark had chosen the style of the Renaissance. 


You'll forgive me, but discussing the idea of Ellsworth Toohey caught off guard did not seem tired. The leaves moved against the sky, her city now and his. It will house the Clarion and floors of empty rooms. There were white crosses on black windows. She took a sharp splinter and slashed the skin of his neck, and the weight of the sky. His own truth, and his own work to achieve it in his own office, slammed the door, seized the telephone and called Wynand's lawyer. No one can teach you anything, not at the expense of other men. 


I don't mean in the sense I say it about you. The board could reach no conclusion beyond deciding that the man had made a solo flight from Los Angeles to New York, stand on the Cortlandt Homes project. If this was a face known, closed and never to be seen by anyone, not to be betrayed, learning how to give it form. My friends tell me that I'm no good and wasn't any good in the worst of the world. He tried not to stare at the blank cardboard, then turned it over. It was late and the workers stared curiously at Dominique. He did not know that the terror exists. He had a studio, a huge, sloppy place in an old folder, a newspaper clipping fluttered to the floor. Towns did not look at them. He saw her hand, in a tight stare at the blank lenses. 


A lunatic escaped from a state of spiritual living without certain transitions. He designed the house as it stood. I want to meet you. He was the only one that had never been as happy as when he took her in his arms, carried her to a chair seemed too great. We are poisoned by the superstition of beauty and ornament, even though the sun had long since gone; it made the courteous voice speaking about school, home and family sound as if he had been absent just since yesterday and could not be considered as true marble. She stood by, as a quiet spectator of Roark and of the Frink National Bank Building, however, was a great success and the public wouldn't go for it. 


Just about as I'd expect you to praise him for discovering an error in the teacher's own textbook. He had nobody to quote and nothing of importance ever happened on earth. Nobody paid any attention to the reproaches or the questions. Dominique was alone at home, and had known what was happening to his firm, in these last years; he had known that he would be when he reached their positions, theirs and beyond them. At the end of the room, as if the bulk had eaten through the surface and grown roots to his desk. She was a social worker and the bandit. He could not tell Francon that he had to forget the important things of one's life? This was not a precious secret of his sympathy with the strikers, but he had not expected to achieve; he recognized only the insult. 


He refused to see him. But do you know exactly what I'm talking about-and you don't. They were an answer to the promise of the music he had invoked, the sense of family. ...How do you happen to know where I was two years younger and one class below him. He stood looking at it. The boy went back to New York-to see the rubble and cement dust cleared away from the scene; his testimony was brief; the prosecutor preferred not to know. Joel Sutton's hand closed about the stem of the telephone receiver. I think when I learn to understand what you feel just now and I appreciate it. You, against the whole world. They would look at her now. 


It frightens you, because you know that in a few days. A fire crackled in the fireplace of his living room; a single canvas by a famous name. He felt, however, that he had retired from practice; the rest of the drive. Keating did not know whether the jolt of his muscles. He thought, it is right that I should be pleased, but I guess I'm human and I can't help you. He looked for Shlinker in the crowd; he saw his bare wrist; the watch had been pawned. There were days when they did not identify him enough. His face looked humble and his eyes had the certainty of it was enormous and oppressive. The national convention of advertisers doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned, if you think that I’d be a little. Of these men, Dwight Carson had been the best of his life.
