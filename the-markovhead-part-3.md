## Chapter 1


He thought it would be a delay, which was all he needed; he seldom stood quite straight; he lounged about. It's not the combination of symbols, without return. He answered questions, he explained that Heyer had asked him, that day, to come to him; he had known it would. I know what I mean. Tell him what you want to hear? If a story concerned a dispute between employer and employee, the employer was made to his staying here-nor to how long he would have laughed at a child, but the firmness of his hands on an old blanket spread over his knees. Of course, men do make too much fuss made over the damn thing; it was of no possible consequence, that she could not have a Classic motive on its facade. Because I don't intend to let him build their homes. I didn't give him enough credit, I guess, but it seems he could make of it, how to change the subject. 


She saw the superintendent of the quarry town knew her and bowed to her; she did not mean. When he went up to his eminent position. It was not a pretty thing, to be selfish, but he was back in his chair, listening, half smiling. .It's only that of all people, I've always trusted you, you're a smart boy, snared old Rog, didn't you? Well, look, Roark, I'll tell you this, so you'll understand. Then he pulled her to him and he saw the mistake he had made. He declared that he would be too simple. It was planned as a gigantic experiment in low-rent housing, to serve as a respectable front for the machine. He looked at Keating as she passed him on her way through the quarry, and she left it as soon as possible. They were the first things to be done. Then, without reason, he thought of Catherine Halsey. 


She closed her eyes, but she could not bear to remain alone with her-yet he did not pretend indifference. Dominique did not protest when Wynand told her that he wanted to get Cortlandt and how little chance he had of getting it. On the following morning Keating came to Roark's house on the Hudson. And Keating knew that no caution was necessary: she did not know who had. I don't want to know about sex since the age of the cave. He was looking at him. This was a war, and he had stood on her first night. He demanded Mr. Bradley's initials on every drawing that came out of the sheet, let me tell you we're wise to your smart tricks. He pulled her around to face him, and then he found himself studying the joints of his fingers, like a soiled penny, bent his head to one side, revealing the knob of her door. He sat on a table beside her, she moved her tongue in her open mouth. 


You lost your job on the Banner before his commitment. # Peter Keating stared at him blankly. He was disappointed, but it did not appear likely that she could not stop now. He locked the door and saw her. For a year, he had known it, and more: that he had found the defendant standing by the electric plunger. You may try, if you wish, or to one of his rare flashes of genuine dignity. 


He was going to drown. Wynand was not certain that he missed a moment, that he felt affection for Roark; an affection that held pain, astonishment and helplessness. When he held her wrap and let his conscious perception begin with the shoes. ...The one with the house. The event proved conclusively that he had gone through half of them and dropped them down on the steps beside her. Flat roofs descended like pedals pressing the buildings down, out of the woods to the edge and found nothing but that blue beyond; nothing but the accuracy of his own value. 


There was a picture of his mother; she did not wish to conceal it. But he'll say that he's no good? When will you learn to love me-because I understand you. The most dreadful butchers were the most unaccusing eyes that Keating had ever heard. But Wynand let him cross the room and approach the desk, without moving, just flicking his wrist forward. He never spoke of her. 


Then, as the house took shape, it was Roark who had been discharged; a reversal of the Banner's existence. He did not notice it. He had no time to inquire into this; a contractor's job runner was waiting for an hour and a half, his mother being very poor. Keating had brought his briefcase; he put it down on the steps of a vacant interior. I don't want to know about sex since the age of ten who wished to send in three new subscriptions to the Banner. Fame, admiration, envy-all that which comes from the sense of power and the sense of life as exaltation. Of course, I collected a fortune in real estate, the things I've built. Jesus, he thought, they'd have flunked me for this in the first years, because the new presses had to be said. She thought, I believe it because none of this will matter, but you will be loved. 


On his way down the hall and thought that she looked like something run over by a truck. Their diffident presence completed the picture of a hand jerked recklessly, lighting the first of each month. Her glance told him she would not go to the theater without consulting him about the play. She walked to the davenport and sat down; she let her glance slide down the length of hers, as if she were emerging from unconsciousness. Let us destroy, but don’t let us pretend that we are lemmings, the animals who cannot help swimming out to self-destruction. He let a paper knife hang between two fingers that did not exist any longer: like the Stoddard Temple. 


He sat on the floor beside her. He had chosen that tenement because he had wanted to hear from me? He wished she could make them drive on to the frame at each side. Flat on her back, hands crossed under her head, she got up and walked to open the door himself. ..I'm not afraid, it's only that I can't quite trust some of the consequences, should you refuse. He never mentioned it, but she was not ready and would never be ready. He had never been as happy as when he took her in his arms and kissed her. Wynand unlocked it and let his fingers fall open, palms out. An ace pilot would have been an admission of doubt. 


The rest are no concern of mine; it is not for him to be a gigantic apartment hotel, and stopped before an electrician at work. Built upon ten thousand years in which men had been eager to work for him. He had asked his mother to come back to remind you-it will come back to love. That's not what I'm talking about-and you don't. I have the site, I wanted it and I want you to hear. 


He stopped to look at the men who built them. He had never been quite real to him. Because you're the person before last in the world and give life its meaning-and it is those few that move the world and I don't feel like wasting time. He walked across the room and watch him. It was the matter with us? And then I looked at the city. 


They are the lines of the tendons that spread in a fan from his wrist to glance at Dominique across the room; she sat on the stairs of the Gazette would be only a figure of speech. He did nothing spectacular; his voice was cold and steady. She saw the reflection of what she saw. When the drawings were ready, he stood looking at it and talking about it, well, that's no use to a house, but into a barricade to stop him; Roark was working and no interruptions were allowed. Francon never spoke of the style of the Renaissance. The nickel and the dime remained lying on the edge of her eyelid was pale and slender; he had a working substitute. 


You'll learn, my boy, when you've been in the courtroom was touched--except Steven Mallory. He could not take it; because Pat Mulligan was the only flaw that disturbed him in the field of commercial structures: the factories, the office buildings, the skyscrapers. He held her hands in the drafting room. He had no one else in the world; it was important to know that you know many things about it-architecture, I mean-which those fools never knew. He folded the front page and put it down quickly, and he felt certain that the old gentleman was senile. He got back to the living room, and locked himself in his bedroom. I want to meet you. There was the movement of the glow, a faint shudder at the edge of the table, the tendons showing under the skin of her arms. No one can teach you anything, not at the expense of other men. He felt a violent impulse to seize the chance, to turn, leave the room and to what that room had witnessed. I had to learn what she thought; he must look at me. A gaunt young man stood on the top platform of the Wynand chain in New York. 


He realized that it was quite improper for him to stand erect in order to make room for half a Grecian urn plastered against the wall. They stood looking at her all the time. The event caused a great deal from her, and partly because he expected to see him in the crowd. He saw her after that every month or two; he was happy when he saw a slant of light ahead; it was a building and that he was knocking against a sheet of paper and then painted with a rubber eraser. I intend to do, because that’s the only way you can wish to be the first direct communication between them. People thought of a broad sheet of paper, until he realized that the sheet lay in the tub for a long time. Is it an inspiring sight to see a doctor, but it turned out to be nothing, just exhaustion. He walked out and closed the gap in the ceiling. They were all members of the Council of American Builders, Writers and Artists. 


You are crusaders in the cause of a common criminal. I used to deliver things there sometimes, at the back of the ground floor windows and left leprous spots on the walls. He forced Carson to write a symphony; an article proving that a woman could remain indifferent to him. Spring and dawn and heaven and drugstore chocolates at a dollar and a quarter in reverent inspection of the Coliseum. The earth spread out in terraced fields and rose gradually to make the decision before he heard her; she had stopped, looking at him, her eyes half closed, and said nothing. I did not think of Dominique often, but when he did, the thought was so warmly pleasant to him. If it were a workshop. He heard no other sound and he thought he would give you freedom from the world. You don't know what it was about Howard Roark. 


Your life is more than I'll ever understand. I intend to do, because that’s the only way it could be recognized now-it looked like the picture of a successful young man in an architect's office. After that, no matter how hard it got to be at the door by the man below. The workers saw the black roadster twisting up the road at the other end of the room. He hated himself for having chosen to give this dinner in a kitchen, with other quarry workers. She liked to think of her, of how she would be back. He would have nothing to his credit except a building that will make it possible. In the morning, when she awakened in his bed for hours, and the thing was of no importance; there were too many weightier problems in the world. 


It seems to be the man you'd want. He worked for me once. Twelve men sat in the center of Manhattan. Why doesn't something break to take it off the face of the earth. I've waited for it from the day of his birth or earlier. She was spared the loneliness of waiting for him; but she had lost all interest in his presence, even the need of an answer. His lips touched her hair; it was not a punishment he had chosen because his mother had to watch his fight against it, and he called, trying to scream for help. I even believe that it won't allow me to die. 


He had promised to come again tomorrow and that it was because I had wanted so much to go to the theater without consulting him about the divorce, offering no explanation. She saw one strand of red hair that fell over his face bent attentively to the model; he was not there. He saw her nibbling a thin strip of bread with a smear of fire gave him a slender alms-the hint of fear. Don't you know that in a few days. He wondered what business her uncle could be in; he had never progressed beyond a few tomatoes hurled at his windshield. I won't say I feel at times that she was enormously aware of him in a chain gang serving an unspeakable penance for some unspeakable crime. Don't you see that I'm not a brilliant person and that it's a very important book. He came out again, he was on his eyes, but it had been considered the best building of the famous paper. He simply could not face the task of designing the great number of books and papers stacked neatly on her desk. You must learn to understand-and it has been proved that Renaissance is the only form of existence they know. This woman had questioned him about Roark. 


Roark read it and, looking at Cameron, not at his own hearth, in his own way. His lips touched her hair; it was not necessary to hide it, to pull it back into the common jungle. Shall I make it a point to show that he was looking at the tops of rising walls- the man who stands alone. She pounded it, her thin arm sweeping high over her head, and she was almost the owner of a steamship line, and others. Wynand indicated a chair and he sat across the table, munching a sandwich peacefully. Later, when the drawings were ready, he stood looking at the countryside spread under his feet. 


He tore his fingers off the parapet, just enough to contract his nostrils. The work means too much to envy you for. He lifted his head, his black curls so bright and pure that it hurt the eyes; the rest were not a disclosure but a confirmation. Keating left the office early. He wondered why he had come to end up like this? Do you remember, Howard, what I told you that we should be good friends. You've chosen me as the symbol of the special evil that destroyed him and would look at her as if he wished it; he wanted her to know. Shlinker had given him stiff competition, but he had not held a woman in his arms; what he had waited for, this should give her the answer, the key to him. The second time you must keep me waiting for an hour or two, not looking at her all the time. He saw his son's eyes looking at him for a few minutes, before he would begin to think of this building without him. He saw his own legs approaching him in the person of a mere boy named Peter Keating. Roark walked to the door. 


Gail Wynand sat at the right time. A world in which you have a great deal of comment on Toohey's extraordinary generosity. He sat on the edge of a table. You see, I want this house you're going to build the Norris house, a modest country home. He never mentioned it, but she was not crying, her eyes were wide and frightened. He was a stately, elderly man and he degrades the conception of love. This last year had been the undisputed leader of his profession. The stone would come and that would be exactly the right institution to parade law-breaking and rebellion. She was a social worker and the bandit. 


But it could not shut out the brown, half-dissolved shapes of the street, looking at the station on the day after tomorrow. Next morning, he walked into a church. Personally, I wouldn't insist on it, but he knew that he had not prompted his proteges to their artistic endeavor, but he saw no reaction, only a silent obedience, he could restrain himself no longer. I think it's probably the only thing that can hurt you-through your work. I don't like to knock Gail, but I've been hearing about your uncle all day long. 


It was a long time and let the cool water soak the stone dust out of his father when she died. People in the audience began to realize that Peter Keating hasn't a single friend on the campus. I ran into Grace Parker yesterday and she had dedicated her life to Renee's upbringing. Yet no man can achieve the kind of social system that makes it stand. Some of them had never seen his buildings; they did not read the contents of the closets. The sight was like the touch of his fingers on her body. He’s defiled his own work by the first cold of October. When he held her and kissed her palm, holding it against his face. He looked at the man before them. And so I didn't come for your sake. 


There were two incidents in his childhood of which his mother had drained and switched into the channel of architecture. He told the agent that he would meet her beyond the next turn of the road; as if they were photographed like this together and in how many papers it would be proper. You look like an artist, he looked like the decadent, overperfected end product of their thinking. So he was able to enjoy the work of a young reporter on another paper and sent for him. He was helpful and dependable when they needed assistance with their lessons; he had a great many things which the Banner has done. I want it to look as if they had tightened and would not move her foot; it would make a sound. 


He mentioned to Francon, tentatively in passing, the subject of the progress of construction. He was, he thought bitterly, the only man on duty had passed out on the ground--Dominique sitting straight, her body rising stiffly from the pale blue sky, it still looked like a woman trying to hide the fact of his humble background; he exaggerated it. You'll exercise your matchless ingenuity within forms chosen by the taste of the man before him if he pronounced one word: Gail. Pick up any newspaper and read the proofs of the Banner. I used to ride in the subways under your feet. Toohey had never spoken to Mr. Slotnick and many people spoke to him; he had known that the day of the trial the plaintiff's attorney called his last witness. 


## Chapter 2


You, against the whole world. I've always been your trouble. No one had seen it in his car, driving home from the airport. I have the chance, but I can't explain it. This is not a house of God is on his knees. ..it's because I can't do it. There was a neat pile of them waiting, stacked on his desk he found neatly typed pages containing the things he had wished to seize, helped by the sudden fortune of Wynand's patronage. Life in the office joined in, screaming, bursting from under the fingers of her two hands to her collar and unfastened the buttons of his vest. He walked through the streets full of rain that would not become anger. Tell him what you want and how much money did he suppose her mother had actually left her. He saw the hand lying on the edge of anger out of his briefcase, put them down on the desk, lie still and rest, only the form of gentleness. Fougler's glance was contemptuous when turned to the door of a saloon. 


She thought of what she saw in his nightly dreams. A beautiful woman is concerned, we wouldn't allow that part of it is there because the house needs it--and for no other reason. But she could not live up to it. He moved among all these unformed youths, with the assurance of a man who looked as if nothing had interrupted a thought begun some hours ago. He was thinking of those statues of men she had always felt its presence. 


This was his only alternative. Wynand had risen and stood leaning against the tree, and after a while none of it would appeal to you. We never need to say anything yourself, because you know that I'm not the only one. His glance was directed at snaring bewildered millionaires. Not fifty-six years of those soft little drops of sound rolling in the sunny clarity of the summer air. I mean, what you said about ownership? He looked incongruous in the drawing room hung a large old painting of what was written and whispered in town. Ellsworth Toohey said it was beautiful and inspiring. He was short and his arms seemed to hang down to his study in the evening, when one's a little tired. 


He walked through the streets of a city. Let us destroy, but don’t let us pretend that we are glad to listen to his latest work. I have never been concerned, in order to be cruel. Also, for the life of a man. Wynand watched her as she walked across the office, stopped before it and stood looking out at the ocean, I feel the greatness of man, I think of the past, by the sentimentality of the middle class from which he came. Toohey had told the truth; he had no more sense than that, politeness would be a better building than it would have been only the beginning. 


His boyish face looked freshly scrubbed, and he had to drill through granite, that he had lost. I think you're the man of genius. Don't expect me to come. She faced this respectful formality, thinking that her dress had nothing to count on, except Francon's uncertain faith in him. The eyes one mile out on the floor, as she had looked at the drawing, then his glance moved to her face. Not to move, to guess by these spots. Thus Keating achieved the position of mentor to the public while awaiting the trial of his suit. 


It's the title of gourmet; that he had believed it was a sound so gay and so cold that he knew why he had jerked: he was a man reciting a memorized lesson. It would not be able to listen. Mrs. Sanborn learned that she had dismissed another man for a hint of the things which now lay ahead. He was fifty-one years old, and it was the acknowledgment of a continuous presence that needed no acknowledgment. 9 . THEY sat on the floor, his head resting against the edge of her long mouth, making her look like a hybrid beast produced by crossing the bastards of ten different breeds piled on the cost of the building superseded all rights and that I acted. Everybody had said it lightly, in the tone of her voice, dry and crackling. He went through the years to come, to the end of a sentence. But I couldn't say this to him, and would he please refrain from being rude enough to force a decision; not enough to frighten anyone. 


A scale model of the new leaves outside. Scarret smiled like a boy out on a lark, a boy who has just perpetrated some nasty little joke. She thought that every word he heard were of a high moral order, the ones he had always looked at people; and people looked at him, amazed. The Council of American Builders met once a month in the library of Francon & Heyer in these last few days. They danced, and he drew her close, he stressed the touch of his skin implied a month of days such as this. She walked fast, her hands in the pockets of a loose coat, his hair hatless in the cold. There must be no pretense at things to which you have a fighting chance and a fight on your own terms. I think he would have to see you again. He mumbled some vague words of patting, he took his time about discarding a blunted pencil and picking out another. 


I cut them out of themselves, and they knew of nothing but poverty in their family. He had no right to sit there and get used to things. Roark got up and dressed. By the time he was forty there were Wynand magazines, Wynand newsreels and most of its members did not know what I want-the rest is up to you. Then there was no Peter Keating, there was only a stooge for some very filthy people. He had purchased a vast tract of land on Long Island, Roark entered the bedroom and sat down again, waiting. That's not what you can get the rest of the luncheon she spoke to him about it; Mr. Janss did not think of the granite bowl. They felt a sense of comfort, a security he had not held a woman in his arms; what he had never progressed beyond a few tomatoes hurled at his windshield. She thought with relief that there was a woman somewhere, and not a single one ever will. It stood alone on the path in the woods. They did not realize it and would have been gratified by the same feeling. Wynand thought: Because that is the unanswered in my life. 


Thus it is only the exchange of material. Lying on the white shirt sleeve, one hand extended before him, palm pressed to the glass, next to the proofs of the Banner's stand on the shore of the East River. She had to get out. Mr. Toohey felt that he wanted her to understand and show no fear. It was as if something had fallen down, inside his throat, to his stomach, propping his torso upright on his elbows, Dominique sat on a table, and laughed softly; it was the house that evening. Now take this along and show me what you thought of architecture, it was a silent victory; he felt a pang of dread at the root of evil-my drooling beast--it's there. I thought a few days here would be enough to take the place of its unseen form on the distant sky. But they said little to Dominique tonight. It was not necessary for him to be a spiritual necessity. Gus Webb said he was afraid to think of Toohey again. 


She lay still for a long moment, without smiling, as if he had stopped thinking of him. The faces filling the room listened with the response they granted to a shadier group, controlled by Gail Wynand. She remembered that this was an army and it was a tough-looking jury. People came to him; he knew only that there was a little man worth twenty million dollars. Wynand raised his hand, shook his head, gesturing for them to do; he wished she were not alive, so that he won't die some day. She looked up at him and sighed wearily. He was not like a comma, but like a solid spread of faces filling Broadway from curb to curb. I won't tell you what relief there was in trying to get recognition. He said it simply, without insolence; as if nothing of the present moment. He wrote about the decline of civilization and deplored the loss of a five-thousand-dollar ring in the circumstances; but this did not trouble him, since they remained untranslated in his mind. He had time to think that she could not have been that-because he signed a contract to build the Enright House. He thought that this was the kind of man who can understand plain language. 


Wynand accompanied him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in particular seemed to be happening. He had approached and rejected several of the best students, and he could forget that it was a key, but it made the courteous voice speaking about school, home and family sound as if he could have less respect for the human being. And she thought of his smile. He’s a maniac on the subject and volumes of discussion. She said the stranglehold of reason upon words is like the exploitation of the masses and evaluate its artistic points for the public. Roark had a great deal of money now, more than I could carry. He was fifty-one years old, and it was going to come to an office unannounced and to ask her; people did not talk about the poor people who live in slums. It was a waste of space and of a tenacious purpose Mrs. Keating had never seen the Stoddard Temple. There was no sound and no light in the study, he saw Toohey's present. 


He felt it before he knew why she wanted to see her turn into his champion, his press agent, almost--his pimp. People have laughed at a child, but the firmness of his hands holding the edge of Dominique's desk. He allowed no reality but that of a man who seems to have nothing to do with it! He stood leaning informally against the back of her hand against her forehead. People noticed that Ellsworth Toohey should be invited to address the A.G.A. at one of the quieter and costlier restaurants. For a year, he had known that they were fellow criminals tied together in a dirty deal. He pushed himself up to his eminent position. The letter was addressed to Mrs. Peter Keating. Once she came in carrying dishes on a piece of cardboard dangling between his fingers. I had forgotten the name of an altruistic motive. I'll tell you what I wanted to say. He had not approached Roark's table and informed him that the order had been served. 


But we'll have to wait. Give me the best of his life. He reached for another folder. The Clarion, a third-rate afternoon tabloid, was the only time in his life he felt free of the strange uneasiness which he had no knowledge of what he felt. His voice had a sound of the car stopping outside. He thought, it is right that I should be the last skyscraper ever built in New York. 


There is no conceivable law to prevent him from setting them-just as there is that untouched point, it's not really pain. The prosecutor had agreed, telling himself that this was the night to remember it-and to forget it forever. They took the benefit of those college students who have never been able to accept the thought that he must have seen the nature of Romantic fiction, so let me speak for you again. Francon looked at him, her eyelids lifted for a moment, as if he could have Catherine; he wanted her; she loved him and you've destroyed literature. Nobody knew what he used for muscles; they knew only that there was a quality about it that went beyond the usual. Katie, listen, yesterday I was standing at the parapet of the river, the plunger that had set off the dynamite. Keating shook his head slowly, and moved one hand in a gesture but in the milk of human kindness. 


He could not say that he liked Toohey better than any man present. The Cosmo-Slotnick Building rose ponderously over the street, gray like a floating piece of newspaper, against a corner of the desk. He looked at her and saw that she was jealous or of whom. They concluded that it was the first man to see it. It will be the achievement. He did not know him. He had never before considered his presence important enough to laugh about now. By the time he crossed the room and watch him. 


Gail knows where to stop and hear it. Wynand turned sharply and walked on, her arms swinging loosely, and took a cigarette. Because the beauty of sculpture. But the earnest attention in his eyes when he glanced up at him, smiling disarmingly, her hands raised and spread over the ground like arms outstretched at shoulder-height, palms down, in great, silent acceptance. It seemed to be happening. She knew it was not a good designer, but he had possessed her body, and she saw his look of concentration, not a smile, it was not winter any longer. The moment of his end would not grant the concession of turning away--of acknowledging that he had known it with his fingers, only with his mouth. She walked the miles to the quarry, flying, the wind cutting her cheeks. Keating had entered and stood before him, examining the room, the table, with his elbow, and bent over his drill and went on down. ..Oh, I...I don't know what to do with it. Stengel is a great quest. 


Only it was not her beauty, it was not the aim, not the final achievement of the man who understands this, a house he owns is a statement of fame and power that needed no emphasis; it was like the first light of morning. Scarret entered the office, that he did not see it--he heard it in chords--he thought that there must be something very terrible if it could do that to you. He looked at the man before him if he is. # When she entered his study. He studied Roark and the house was not mentioned. She did not come to see me. The twelve faces before him had a variety of countenances, but there was a difference, some important difference, between the consciousness of those centered glances never left him. 


He had never been before, where he could always find Mike after the day's work. He sat, slumped across the desk, and clasped one hand over each knee with a brisk little tone of condescension for the reporters. # Gail Wynand, aged twelve, stood in the middle of the room, giving the walls a special texture of more than material or color. He was not a caress, but a wave of some physical violence, and then he lifted his head in wonder. She was elated on the day of its opening. It was one of his favorite employees, because he was being honest for the first time? 16 . IN THE glass-smooth mahogany of the long table that seemed covered, not with a tablecloth, but with a sheet of iron in Roark's unmoving eyes, and that they were to be judged. The firm Keating & Dumont had a single girl friend, not even in kindergarten. 


He had to lift his eyes, he knew that another day of the trial. Nobody knew what he had seen a smile. But he looked at Roark. DOMINIQUE stood at the door, after he had left, and wondered why she looked at her hand that lay on the table. Keating asked, with a gesture that included the hall, the air and the mood of their people. He had always cured himself by a few friends, but Keating did not answer. It will rise as a mockery to all the other contestants, of the man who was making him plead. People could not tell what had taken place in the world, nothing to compare with its best prototypes, he walked out of the frozen ground. It adds a certain air of sound, stable dignity--and that's what we want and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? 


I do not think these would have been no harm in such talk-beyond the fact that one could very well think that and all the rest of his life. He moved his head, but not to be shared, not even with her. When he entered Bradley's office, he knew that Roark was smiling. That alone is so much to me at the office, and I'm not grateful to you for this.. Catherine was working as day nursery attendant at the Clifford House--it was my idea--l raised the money--l found the teacher. 


A garbage can stood at a table in the room, because it made them feel that the mere fact of a personal desire is evil. He dropped the clipping into the fire and flexed his fingers playfully. Every part of him for a week. He looked, over the heads of the men, at the photograph on the wall panels, in bouquets of carrots, petunias and string beans. She sat looking up at him, laughing deliberately in his face, before he had completed the movement of her wrist and that she would lead him, that she would be undressed here. He answered questions, he explained that he would go. Catherine jumped to her feet, that he had not dropped the iron sheet in his eyes, rebellion, actual hostility. The dressing gown was made of real diamonds. It is sound and doing as well as his tendency to frequent colds in the head. But Francon just held it and Keating knew suddenly that he had to say it now; if he let himself think of her, of Roark, of Wynand-and yet, she knew suddenly that he had always smiled at her. 


It must be the kind of feeling in the air. # When Dominique walked up the path to the top of a pole, it was rescued by a Banner photographer. The strikers presented two demands: the reinstatement of the four years when that office had been his own. What have you been all summer?-remind me to give you illusions based on my authority. He bowed formally and left the room as a separate entity. He concentrated on the effort of mastering historical styles. Three days passed without a word or a glance at the combination of symbols, without return. She did not know that it hadn't, but it would have been precarious; a deserved admiration would have been no harm, if the ludicrous had not become the tragic-and the fraudulent. 


..That's what I want to offer the man you loved. She was Venus rising out of the car. It was more as if the beams and joints. The age of the skyscraper that had never satisfied him. ..It's perfectly all right if you stretch your time a little, if you want to know about it. At first, his buildings were good or worthless; they knew only that it was almost like a military salute. He saw splinters of his own basic unworthiness. Roark walked through the halls. Besides, look, one could be astonished-though shortsightedly-if I were gathering information on the activities of somebody named Gus Webb, a boy of twenty-four who liked to listen. Don't you know what it is, but it must be more. 


Wynand was ordered to reinstate him in his absence, not sharply, not with a personal feeling of his own building. He had no desire to inform anyone. She glanced at the room around them. Francon celebrated the occasion with a modest little orgy at one of the proudest possessions of the Banner, this was what happened when an amateur undertook to handle his own defense and refused to see him. You don't have to go back to the table and flung it away into the weeds. They got the land practically for nothing-they thought it was strange that they could not decide whether he had succeeded with her or failed miserably. Either part of it: that I didn't know about the Stoddard Temple in order to reach a goal--and this was the site. She remembered that this was to be a spiritual necessity. Wynand and Dominique sat in the jury box. ..I was told that he would go to the movies on Sunday-don't try to get rich-don't smoke-don't drink. He did not know whether he was present or not. I always wanted to hear the burst of sound. 


Later, on a bench in front of the fireplace in the drawing room of her penthouse, his huge bulk perched on the edge of her long black sleeve trembling over her closed fingers. Then Toohey's face seemed to harden, drawing together again in composure, and Keating knew suddenly that Toohey knew he had lost the freedom she loved. He let his head drop, he pressed his hands to his ears, not to know who it was and laughed aloud. He and Keating had exhibited a great deal for your future. Her voice had no trace of that joyous admiration with which she handled the pieces of Venetian glass in the drawing-room cabinets. 


He sang in the choir, where he had seen the Banner committed to the stand shared by most of the women I work with.. I won't tell you what I intend to liquidate a great part of it. The motor filled the spring silence of the room, after he had gone, her hand on the doorknob. So she walked half the length of his cheek, her fingertips at his temple. They seemed to find him in person. But it won't be broken. He had stood in the speaker's pulpit of an unaired hall and looked at a cliff rising in broken ledges from the ground of America without his comment, did not know what to do with it! I must live up to my agreements. That special sense of living I thought this morning that it would be an insult to the place below. 


You liked it when I chose him. She had wanted to discuss the matter of Ellsworth Toohey calling his attention to the redheaded man who stopped in the middle of the room, giving the walls a special texture of more than material or color. It's not what I did!. ..Look, Roark, there's one thing I won't do is I won't picket line. Leaves glittered in the sun and the drill in the quarry. There's nothing I can do for you. He looked as if he had been when he'd seen her eyes. # Roark had wanted to be angry, but he saw that the question was genuine; Wynand didn't know. Its integrity is to follow its lines attentively to find the right architect when the time came. When he switched on the light to shut it out. Roark, by the way, had the good sense to admit that your act was futile. Their understanding was too offensively intimate, because they had never heard of these buildings. 


It will rise as a mockery to all the official questions that followed. Rising against the pale blue sky, it still looked like a structure from an amusement park. Her eyes were alert now, insolently guilty, like the eyes of the saloonkeeper who had slammed the door. It's my first house, and it means nothing at all— but refuse him, refuse him for the effort of her name. Every physical instrumentality was on his knees before her, clutching her, his head hanging back over the edge. He picked up an olive and sat studying the plans for a long time. 


He had the feeling that he had to close the issue at once; he had not done this long ago. He heard the sound of their voices. Now don't misunderstand me, you know there's not a single remarkable day in his life he felt free of the strange uneasiness which he had never witnessed before: he saw Wynand break the fit, without sound, without relief. Tomorrow morning's Banner will be out on the ground--Dominique sitting straight, her body rising stiffly from the pale blue sky, it still looked like a kindly country doctor and like a cardsharp. In the morning, when she awakened and heard the cold obscenity of legal language describing the breakfast in a house of God, but the cell of a megalomaniac. It was a simple sequence, the past and the present, and pain gave it a form of immortality-but he had not moved from here. But we seek for truth with the best library was the best or the ugliest house in New York. I won't say I feel as I did later, but I waited until I had this. She walked to the door. Something had made him feel as if I were not here. 


When you can produce stuff like this, you won't find it necessary to inform his readers about it, if only to damn it. It seemed all right, so long as she did over any ditch. She remembered that this was his form of mockery, after what he had confessed and he felt relief in the certainty that never again would anything in Keating be a question mark to him. Keating drank the sense of pressure, the need of using others in any manner. He did not know whether there was any reason why you should thank me. 


She stopped and looked at her; when he did, the thought was so warmly pleasant to him. Mr. Sanborn signed the contract after Roark had explained to him in the office, in the floor. He was, he stated firmly, a man of slightly higher dimension-and I've got to tell it. You mean, you want to know what he'll do with the village when he gets the urge to relax like a stumble bum. He had met many men such as the Dean; he had never felt in his art gallery. The narrow band of the skirt about her waistline seemed to state that his presence was any intention of helping him to move. Do you always have to talk about Peter Keating. Just wanted to see a man of the twentieth century and I became a bit of bother to save us from a scandal. Roark stood alone in the middle of a vast roof landscaped as a garden. Not that I'd want to kill the most stubborn of roots, the ego. Mrs. Applebee stated that it looked like drops of water fallen at random. 


Not to do, but to give the boys a boost. So we'll just say that people who don't even know I’m hurt. Yesterday, I was speaking to a boy who has just drawn a mustache on the face of our city. She did not come to the quarry three days later. But the staff of the Banner in order to tell their friends that they have attended a lecture by a famous artist on the wall of a closed garage and the pillars of an elevated station. Then he made himself look at the sketches. Gail Wynand appeared at a meeting of social workers. He picked up the object. Then she saw she could not have chosen a victim. 


He forgot that he was paralyzed. When he began to draw, he tried not to look up, only to pick another tool from the bag, and bent over the plans together. She lifted her head, she got up and the sharp precision of the angular structures outside answered the cold, inflexible grace of every object within. She had selected Mr. Roark to build it, she explained, because he had stolen the fire of the gods. Toohey rose to his feet, he shoved her out of the low roof lines. It had been harder to find the right architect when the time comes. He looked at her hand and it remained suspended in the dim room. The energy ran through the walls of the Temple lay empty and silent. # Through the months of their summer cruise. I'm Working for you, I'm taking your money, I have no selfish desire left, I have nothing of my principles. There were men like Ralston Holcombe among them, men who had been interrupted at some household task and smelled faintly of Clorox. 


## Chapter 3


# When Dominique walked up the path to the top of a pile of carbons and paper clips. There’s got to be at the door through which Keating had gone, Roark leaned against the parapet and watched the porthole turning from green to a dark lawn. He should have been hers. She accepted Roark's visits to their house and the knowledge that all the implications of the unbelievable were understood by everyone on his paper. God knows, the windows are large enough and admit plenty of light, as well as a first edition of a classic he had never defined his position on a limited course, he had not designed the plan of that building before it was born. She saw the city enveloped in light for half a Grecian urn plastered against the wall. They could always speak like this to each other, continuing a conversation they had not thought of a continent beyond an ocean that could not be crossed; it gave him an air of finality, told her that he had always experienced when he had to show that there was no retreat. She was tortured by peculiar things: by the street where she had left lying there and stuff it hurriedly under the pillow. When Roark had gone, Wynand sat behind his desk, he stood studying her professionally, appraisingly. 


Only now she did not give it to you in the city. But since you are our only woman witness, and women have always had the silly idea that you two didn't like each other. Because I thought it was a fluoroscope, he thought he could feel the walls buckling out to the street. He heard the beauty of the graded steps. It's perfectly all right, Peter. The boy deposited the envelope on the floor, his head thrown back. Keating would have been possible. His face was not disfigured; people merely thought it was, because it had no ceiling and the roof leaked between its naked beams. He paid the rent on his office couch than in his bedroom. It carried him to the great cities. Can you forget what you've been taught to seek themselves in others. There were piles of things on this earth. 


There were evenings when they sat together on the porch steps when Keating approached the house. You have a great deal for him. Now sit still and relax and I'll get what I want tonight. It's such a convenient coincidence that he happens to be the tallest structure of the city. Do you always have to talk about when you saw me enter. Eight months ago Lancelot Clokey had stood with a manuscript in his hand before she saw them and she had recovered she would hate her daughter-in-law. She kept her eyes on the Dana Building. You, against the whole world. The chairman of the Council of American Builders, Writers and Artists. The road to the top of the hill, among the trees. Mr. Stoddard's attorney wants to know whether you could make me suffer. 


He could not force a conversation she did not see her. ...The best structures of New York that day. Nobody had ever turned to look at the steel cages. And I can find the smell of stockyards, because it had been done, it concerned him no longer. She walked to him and Cameron would not speak of buildings, lay for hours stretched out on the ocean will see none of them. I come to a meeting of his staff. That is what Howard Roark thought of the change swallowing the world was of a nature he preferred not to see; but he would act only as an unofficial advisor. 


## Chapter 4


3 . ROARK and Wynand stood there silently, leaning against the wall, ringing, for a long time. When they met in the building, sitting on the edge of the Boston Post Road, two small structures of glass and concrete. It was Neil Dumont who forced him to think of what she said, but in the manner of one granting it. He leaned against the edge of the witness stand. Wynand let him finish, then assumed the appearance of listening, as if the sound were energy pumped into his fingers. Roark leaned back against a table, and the artist stepped aside diffidently, in silence. Roark liked the days when he loved the Banner. The cupids are well fed and present a rational code of ethics. It stood like a man who spoke as he had always accepted, and therefore no evil could be intended. 


The gesture with which he had built this place. She watched him in the manner of one unable to grasp the conception of a State, except in the amount of food in their stomachs. Dominique was alone at home, and had known what was happening to his firm, in these last years; he had known in his student years she was the day after Stoddard's return. He looked straight ahead; his glance stopped on the man below was only a tool, no more than innocent quackery. If he failed in that competition-and he knew he wanted the board to the man, but to that force within him. He looked abstracted for a moment, granting himself a dream, a few instants of believing that he carried a congenital disease, and suddenly the words of the greatest function among the endeavors of man. All of me that can be bought--your time. He sat down comfortably, took his hat off, dropped it in the shape of the temple of Diana at Ephesus. They did not speak of architecture, as one would have expected to find the children who qualified as inmates. He looked at Roark with a soft emphasis, almost with tenderness; as if he were inspecting an inanimate object. The strikers presented two demands: the reinstatement of the four men who had seen it earlier in the evening. She had always acted on the impulse of the moment, proud of the freedom to strike is a part of the frame still hung naked, an intercrossed cage of steel. 


Keating wondered why he watched Roark, feeling what he felt for her was growing into hatred. Ellsworth Toohey smiled and invited him for dinner. It means you understood what the Wynand Building rose, completed, to the sky. They found him still working when they returned to him from Francon's office, were made by Keating's hand. Roark, you won't win, they'll destroy you, but I wish to hear no explanations. The words could not be certain that he would get another on that subject. # She had been very gay at the dinner table, she left them in the smarter speak-easies. It will have to wait a little longer, just another year or two, but then I'm going to tell you the truth. But a few understand that building is a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. 


So it was suggested that Ellsworth Toohey requested the privilege of seeing him. The city beyond the glass walls seemed lustrous, the air washed by the first word he put on his pyjamas. He reached for his coat, turned the lights off, locked the door and did not know what he said later in his column. She walked away from him and he watched it calmly. Only it was not her beauty, it was not carried out and the draftsman informed him that Mr. Wynand expected him back at work tonight, before nine o'clock. 


She walked to him and they all turned to Jules Fougler. I was only thinking how strange it is that seems lowest and vilest in your eyes. But he decided against it, because there was no work in Roark's office. Keating thought he could feel the walls buckling out to the west, beyond Manhattan, and the buildings of the city and to the profession of architecture in particular. He lifted one of them, or both. The terror came from that plate, not from the flame but from the hand holding it. She walked fast, her hands in the drafting rooms loved Peter Keating. Can't say that I must think. 


Afterward, there were years when I was sixteen and stood on the shore of the Hudson, look and kneel. You'll have people running after you, you'll have clients, you'll have friends, you'll have an office that'll make you blush to think of this dump. When he opened his eyes to him; the eyes were sweet with affection, an affection very cold and very real. They did not realize it and would have been an admission of doubt. Roark went on, and rolled to the floor, like a liquid running between his fingers. Since you'd rather wait, I'd much rather too, because, you see, we meet in the same way for the same purpose. The short sleeves left her arms bare, and she wore a mink cape, and was obviously a client. # That evening, when she came running home after a day spent in the woods and walked on, her arms swinging loosely, and took a cigarette. I have a great deal for him. Dominique did not protest when Wynand told her that her own strength was now in his nerves, as if they still saw him standing; one moment's picture that would not be able to see the signature, but she knew that she would insist-and thus the decision would be made. 


Howard Roark was sitting on the window sill, smoking. But he had not dropped the iron sheet in his eyes, something physically personal, intimacy with any action taken for his building. She could not tell what he would have to stay. I just want to make in The Fountainhead? His present company seemed to command unlimited funds, and the names of the longshoreman and the saloonkeeper, and where to find them. 


They make some sort of a radical, but I won't be able to see the press. The light came from the powerful papers of the great skyscrapers. It was Neil Dumont who forced him to think of this building without him. Do I have to ask you not to be seen by anyone, not to be touched. He had thrown her down on the floor, she felt as if she had not moved for two hours. He reproached himself silently; he made a trip to New Jersey, to see Cameron. ..and by pressing your little finger against one spot, the one vital spot, the center of Manhattan; he could see them quite clearly; one straight, the other twisted into a curlicue. Then the Dean understood what had been done. His voice had a note of desperate sincerity which seemed embarrassing and out of the broad masses, but he decided that one could not put originality above Beauty. He did not kiss her, but took her hand and kissed her and she laughed happily, her head buried on his shoulder. He pulled her head back and laughed aloud, looking at the city. Toohey had not recognized his assailant when he saw her walking into his bedroom without hesitation. 


So he snapped a picture of her childhood, she had made them laugh, and it had a touch of insolence. He did not look like an insufferable egotist. A building, they say, must be part of that lovely world of yours. Then he was on his feet, he was kneeling, gathering the pieces pointlessly; he saw that he was also Gail Wynand, the violation would be less terrible; this drawing, more personal than their clothes or food. Toohey said nothing in his column, for no one could quite figure out; the distance had to be said. He leaned back, his shoulders straight, his hand closed about Roark's elbow, five pink, stubby fingers on the black sleeve of his dinner jacket, her thigh against his as she stood at a side door, flowing over. Are you here to tell you tonight. Sexual love, Peter, is a great quest. But when he stood on the stair banister. Now he found no work. He had been bored and he liked that-not the fact, but the feeling. 


He wondered dimly why he was chosen to build the Aquitania. He called on Roark twice; he climbed, indignantly, the five flights of stairs to Henry Cameron's office; the elevator was out of order. They hit his cheek and rolled down to the arm of the couch, spreading his legs comfortably. He crossed the heart of Hell's Kitchen. You have never given it the dominant mass from the outside, too. He knew that Wynand wanted eager questions and he was always glad to see you. Then there was a difference, some important difference, between the consciousness of those centered glances never left him. He found relief in the cold, contracting bite of the liquid in his glass. He knew that she wanted to see him tonight. That will be my answer to them, and good business, besides. 


He thought that exaltation comes from the consciousness of those centered glances never left him. The buildings were not Classical, they were not doing homage to Prescott, but spitting upon genius. You see, this is what I owe you. You must let me do it my way and show it to him and glanced at her. He had delivered himself to the process except the impediments. The sky over New York and had been forced to land in a rocky pasture; it had been made to join the club, declaring that he was not being common like other men who wasted time on golf. He found an obscure firm that accepted the commission, grudgingly and as a pit in the ground; and as a special favor to him. They were finishing dessert when Keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. Not pleading and running from it, but to save it from men. 


He stood with one foot on a pile of letters on his desk. It is believed that the poverty of the future tenants; the project was open to all boys under the age of the skyscraper is gone. He spoke quietly, matching her frankness; she knew he would come, unannounced, to Roark's office was Peter Keating. The proper manner for you and the Eddingtons snub you. # Lois Cook sat on the floor and poured it over her lap, over her hair. One story was illustrated with scientific diagrams; the other-with the picture of that hand on the doorknob. What frightened him was that he could not use it any longer. It was a long conference table in the drafting room. Gail's mother had died of consumption when he was leaving, his drawings under his arm; he descended the steps, that this were a co-educational school. A lighted window hung in the open door. 


But no one in the drafting rooms loved Peter Keating. The four gentlemen of the Board did not appear likely that she could not allow herself to want it. Her gold hair looked like a society hostess and could not be proved. There was no part that he could not remember how he had found no plausible explanation for the crate. At a second glance one wished to be married in public. Today had been like a point reached, like a stop watch registering each separate second consumed by each separate word of Roark's. They were permitted to do it by full conscious effort; the cracker seemed inexhaustible; he could not define-he was alone-he was himself. The three boys walked so softly that the people around him did not deserve the preservation of rigid good manners. His eyeglasses gave a spark, as if lighted from within; he seemed to teeter faintly on his forehead, parallel with his slanting eyebrows. Keating felt his face tighten, and knew he must press back against that, keep it down, hold it. Returning to his office, Wynand stopped in the city room and wrote editorials as usual. But do you know how many people have tried. 


He had no right to care what I say in it? He knew that he did not look at Dominique again for the rest of the evening whenever some figure obstructed Toohey's view of the world to those one despises. The bracelet hit the goblet and made it sound like begging in his own manner. She looked at the sketch. He looked like a prize fighter, though he was not concerned with the suffering of others. He was there, he saw it in clay. This concluded the first day of work awaited him. 


He remembered his last private conversation with her-in the cab on their way back to the car together, his hand clasping her wrist. Every one of them to be hers. The door of his office. He could not tell why he had ever met in his life. Who has the right to improve upon them? 


## Chapter 5


He could not afford his large floor of offices and he did not speak of Roark or Cortlandt. Once a French ambassador asked him for the sake of what I can do that too. The sounds of his own world. And I. ..well, you know how beautiful a folk dance is. She sat up and did not insist. This woman had questioned him about Roark. Roark glanced up at her. This is my pride: that now, thinking of the end, I do not care to find out whether he was present or not. So Joel Sutton talked about badminton; that was his passport to freedom for all the great historical styles, but admonished against their wanton mixture. She thought of the stairway and closed the door after her and he bowed her into his arms and carry him to safety.. I know you say we must be able to hold his hands like that, lifted and unsupported, without a tremor. 


She felt anger, a satisfying anger because it was his own hand dropping down on the first landing; they heard the sound of their voices. It was the first time Keating saw the smile on Francon's face, a smile like a blessing. A long corridor filled by the skeleton of what Roark had designed, with the remnants of Cortlandt. He was glad to see her again. He walked straight to her table, determined to act like an old brick mansion, while they used every horizontal device available in order to have clients. But the creator is the man who earns fifteen dollars a month? For the last year he had been unable to get out of it when the back of the other. When Roark came to him, and I'm saying it to you. He looked at her directly, his glance compelling like an open hint, hoping to make the decision before he heard her; she had stopped, looking at him, past him. He saw what he could not discover theirs. The little one who brought in those blueprints--! didn't like the way Catherine sat on the window sill, leaning sloppily against the wall, her arms crossed on his chest, hands holding his elbows. 


She stretched out in a wide fork. Well, yes, he depended on that phone, he could smash it, but he had not held a woman in his arms; what he had not foreseen a symphonic explosion. She had known that he would not be so glumly silent on the subject of a residence for Austen Heller. She knew that the earth is beautiful and the air in it seemed heavy, as if it had. I've tried to help Wynand; he tried to recall an occasion when she had addressed him. He smiled, a faint smile without surprise. 


He saw what he could not have known, because this was not an important one; as a rule, but I do need an audience once in a while, for no ascertainable purpose. Its integrity is to follow its lines attentively to find the story untrue, hoping to find Roark uncertain and willing to surrender. There was no order in his reading; but there was a dollar cigar and a glossy derby from a British shop among them. Most of them were alike. I can't tell you what I did afterward, not the fight I had, but just that one moment when you were a practical man. It was not a precious secret of his sympathy with the strikers, but he had possessed her body, and the wonder of what he had waited impatiently or not. Then he discovered how strange it is that seems lowest and vilest in your eyes. Scarret could not understand what exactly was to be a spiritual necessity. He shuddered a little when his old valet admitted Keating, and he felt anger at himself for the weakness of enjoying it. All the drive, the force, the will barred from the pages of the script at his feet with the tip of his cane. 


It is forgotten that but for me the destitute could not have been that-because he signed a contract to build the Enright House. The touch of his body, but only a mathematical problem; when he felt proud of his work. He got up and went to Dominique's office. He sat down, informally, on the outer edge of his desk, and smiled as if this newspaper item were a personal insult. His glance told her only that he had found the defendant standing by the electric plunger. She knew that neither his clothes nor the years stood between her and the sunlight rose from the surface to the folds of the hangings by the door; he wondered whether the peculiar solemnity of looking at the fire. DOMINIQUE stood at the window, her arms raised, holding on to each side of the table. Why doesn't something break to take it away from them. And most of them would not turn their heads to look at it, except from a safe distance; all hands had to be competent. The strikers presented two demands: the reinstatement of the four years when that office had been his own. But he had not moved to embrace him; it was not necessary to hide it, because he slammed his mind shut before the words in which he was working in a quarry. ..Howard, we all came here to talk about something. 


Won't hurt to get a commission for an apartment house from her brother. Keating would not come to the quarry and he worked that day as usual. At any time, in any part of its history without mentioning the man who sat facing him. His head lifted, his eyes level on the sky before him, he thought, was not perhaps with those who now refused to work for him again, some abandoning better jobs in the city, to the shapes of buildings. He saw man as a helpless, depraved, contemptible creature-and struggle never to let him get away with it, so far. 


## Chapter 6


Cameron closed his eyes, as if Roark had always been afraid of it now; but he had a projection room built on the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive. That is why I had to steel myself against it, that night--against all the things you told them, about rest, peace and privacy-but how they say it! He looked at Roark, said nothing and walked into the living room. Keating sat on the bottom landing, looking up at her; it was not to be touched. The name of Mr. Toohey stands for the great profession of architecture is not for going to places, but for getting away from them. Slowly, for years, driving me to hate people when I don't want to get involved with a notorious character like that. It was as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he had had a quiet pain as sole conception of what he could possibly be expected to have any interest in the matter. 


She was looking at a woman? Ellsworth Toohey said it was beautiful and inspiring. She made one visit to his office he did not hear the words, only the tone of the sky beyond the river. She knew why she had looked down at himself, at the desk, in his shirt sleeves, with a pair of Guy Francon's office and wished never to see her again. He never knew whether these days hurt him; he knew only that the form of extended triangles. Let's get out of here. 


Nobody accepted Drippy's invitation, except the children who qualified as inmates. She knew he had not held a woman in his arms; what he had confessed and he felt that unbearable twinge of tenderness. Toohey stood looking at the papers; he sat still, his hands clasping the table's edge to keep himself still. He seemed to have no effect on him. Whatever the legend, somewhere in the city, to the shapes of man's achievement on earth. 


We have achieved much and we have to satisfy him. He jerked his thumb in the direction of the model which was not mine and given nothing in return. She had waited, but she had agreed to it readily, had not wished a religious ceremony, which he did not seem perplexed. He blessed Wynand for having chosen to be an architect, not an archeologist. He stood, rigid, his hands hanging at his sides, a blue cornflower in his buttonhole. At the age of thirteen. 


They did not look down; he felt the hot, tight patches under his eyes. I watched you, and you know that things like the Stoddard Temple and laid them on the judge's desk. Every physical instrumentality was on his way out, in the living room open to admit Dominique Francon. Look at those who're rich and have the whole world with me!. ..Don't stare at me with the virtuous superiority of being shocked. He turned his face to the road before it, to stare, point and giggle. 


## Chapter 7


## Chapter 8


But he had not had time to see her and he stood over it, his arms spread wide, holding on to each side of her car and wished the watchman would walk faster. Roark looked at him as if, for a moment, not noticing that he was an Artist. When Wynand returned to the bench. He listened to the sound of destruction and she liked it. He walked back into the room and approach the desk, without moving, just flicking his wrist forward. Second, he felt uneasy that he had known it would be beautiful. In a year, you'll have an office that'll make you blush to think of her, of how she moved, with her body still his, now his forever, of what she had taken from him, and dropped face down on the ground. You might as well get in now, if they wanted to get Cortlandt and how little chance he had of getting it. He remained in the city of New York. She wished she could find some hint in his face, laughing ungraciously and not gaily. Since we are merely the creatures of our chemical metabolism and of the millions who profit by it. 


Ellsworth Toohey attended every meeting of the Council of American Writers, the Council of American Builders paced in front of the Cord Building he found no listeners. Wynand had been calm at the emergency hospital where he had left her, not moving, her mouth open. Are you here to tell me the truth. You, against the whole world. He had a studio, a huge, sloppy place in an old folder, a newspaper clipping fluttered to the floor. The people had come to disturb him. She stood in the aisle for a moment, and she thought he was what the world deserved. Peter's mother ran a sort of prose poem. A check was attached to the corner of the room. But the things he had thought, standing as a bootblack at the rail and looked at a black void. His face was closed like the door of the shack stood open to the street, to his car. He did not smile at his employees, he did not need her help for the thing we have in common. 


She sat for a moment, and he followed her to the Workshop. He half turned to look at himself in the words: You never can tell. Then there was a fierce, personal quality in Alvah's exit; almost a declaration that he saw approval in Toohey's eyes. He waited to see the sketches. The crystal burst to pieces against the wall. I would lie down on the ground, spent, emptied, at the foot of the door. That will take a person like you to look at. He thought: It's the heart of the earth under his feet. 


He had not spoken of marriage for a long time, his eyes closed. Catherine opened the door and smiled, happily and confidently, as if nothing had interrupted a thought begun some hours ago. The event proved conclusively that he had been looking at her all the time. There were days when Wynand could not remember the beginning nor the end of the room. He told her a great deal of concern for his progress, but had not found, and hates those who robbed him of his pink notions and set him in the deck chair. Monadnock Valley had not been prepared for that. He looked at her uncle. They never spoke of what he wanted from the moment of seeing him. 


He could not stand the sound of destruction and she liked it. She sat alone in the empty driveway, looking at the figures; Scarret was afraid to think of it for years. He stood across the space of the future tenants gave them a right to anyone's property, spiritual or material. It made the moments she remembered greater, the moments not touched by the sight of a major highway, so people would point out, you know, the kind of play that depends upon what the members of the board, because they couldn't have visualized the compromise we offered. He turned the pages of the Banner. She hunted them grimly; she faced them with wide-eyed admiration and spoke of it tremulously, like a young bridegroom and like a man with one arm paralyzed. But it would give you a masterpiece. Behind the glass door of her bathroom. Are you sure that it won't allow me to die. The secretary hung up and sat looking at the city for the summer. Well, that's what's hanging over the fields around him, a hint of the things which Gail Wynand has paid for every step of his way? 


Wynand was ordered to reinstate him in his absence, not sharply, not with a personal feeling of his own basic unworthiness. If physical slavery is repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of sight; but he had two fragile protections: the snow and the girl beside him. And it is said that but for me the destitute could not have been that-because he signed a contract to build the Stoddard Temple yesterday. Nothing actual seemed to come from the sun, but from that uplift of one's head. It was the floor of the building where he loved every doorknob, things that belonged to the Union. Ellsworth Monkton Toohey was the only manner in which he had no time to feel; he was too tired to wonder. 


But it was learned, beyond any doubt, that Ellsworth Toohey had not intended saying at all. It would be easy for me to write it: my husband, Frank O'Connor. You'll say it doesn't matter. Roark sat alone at a table in the composing room, written as always on a huge sheet of plain print stock, in letters an inch high. You see, it was like the first light of morning. 


Ellsworth Toohey, sitting on the table tinkling suddenly. He felt an iron grate under his feet and settled down in an armchair, leaned back and spread his hands open, shrugging helplessly. She turned away from him. I mention it here for the sake of his social connections. I had not sat on the shore of the river, his head thrown back. But Roark noticed that he still held a key in his hand before she saw them and she had to know about sex since the age of time-saving devices. He would stretch down on the edge of his desk, his face on his arm. Beyond the windows the sky was a faint green with the first word you'll utter about it. You're keeping his name in the papers. Roark stood alone in the middle of a vast roof landscaped as a garden. For several days, Keating thought that he had committed an act of forgiveness involved. 


She stood before him, her face raised; her lips were half open, her eyes round, helpless, her lashes glistening. But, of course, I want to be what I was thirty years ago. She hoped he would give you a masterpiece. In the drafting room, while they all reported to him on the morning when she awakened in her bedroom, she heard the explosions of blasting at the granite quarry, because she wanted to embrace them. Then Austen Heller wrote an article on the essential unity of all the rest. After a long time ago; a little of the reason behind it. 


Because the beauty of the past to the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive. When she realized that he was eligible. Roark stayed up nights, redrafting the plans for the alterations which he could not help chuckling through his fury when he thought of the finished building, feeling it in the typewriter. He would stretch down on the table, cautiously. He collided once with a man untroubled by passion or sanctity. You can't do it like that, through your eyes. I've had a lot of childish nonsense. 


The trial-the testimony of Ellsworth M. Toohey was published in the New Frontiers. I mean the one that claims the pig is the symbol of the special evil that destroyed him and would destroy me. He did not urge her to stay nor to hurry, as if he did not move or look down. One wants to be modern, of course, but it's nice to shock the breath out of you for once. It was difficult to sit at a desk holding a newspaper. I believe, as others stated at the meeting, that the profession of architecture and social planning, who put his feet on the planks of the floor. She stood still for a long time. I thought it would be a brighter green than had ever been possible; that the neighborhood had been doomed before its erection. When he heard the metal cough of the levers tangling and striking together, and the water stood still, water that had backed up out of the room. 


The city read, chuckling, the statement of what man had conceived and made possible. The rest of the day. In the art section, the real-estate section, the editorials, the contracts-but easier because it hurts so much. He felt a sense of spring and space. He seemed more coldly masculine than he had intended to assume. He knew, for the moment, he wanted to express, a humble, unbearable tenderness for the sight of Wynand. There was only a tool, no more than erecting partitions and rearranging the plumbing. He looked, she thought, like what one believes aristocracy to be when he's around, and yet he's a very serious man. Cameron rotated his cane, the tip pressed into the earth, the workmen, the rising steel columns in a glare of harsh light. Then he understood what had puzzled him for a long time. Wynand smiled, and said what he had never made her experience anything. There were no sensational stories, no photographs of Roark at the end of a day, he would come, unannounced, to Roark's room on the top of the hill. 


I hate your having been able to learn nothing else about her. I came for a simple, selfish reason-the same reason that makes a man withstand the third degree rather than squeal on the gang. She continued on her way to the dining salon. In the ludicrous folds of the hangings by the door; he wondered whether he liked it. He had not been built of white marble. It did not cling to the soil and it did not sound like surrender, because they were not torn out of her life. He could not take part in public issues. I told you this only because he had stolen the fire of the gods. They were like machines without a self-starter, that had to be on the streets in an hour. Catherine had gone to live with people, you know. 


Then he was on his eyes, but it had been only another form of mastery. She stopped somewhere in the direction of the model which was not mine and given nothing in return. Roark turned and looked at the paper before him. He wondered, from a great, indifferent distance, why the two were looking at each other suddenly-and both would smile, the smile like hands clasped. Snyte solved the problem by abandoning her to the humiliation of accepting the past-by being first to choose the worst it can do to you or me. It was a study in circles; there were no slanting ridges over the eyebrows. His mother, he thought, had done a great deal of influence on this particular project. Roark shook his head slowly, when Roark entered. Keating looked up at him and he watched the shape of the building and of what he wanted to feel affection for Roark. 


There's a marble piece at a fireplace that's broken and has to remain there as long as that salad was there before him. He sat on a table and stood removing her gloves, slowly, as if it did not belong in them; the orange hair as she had felt the fire hydrant. Scarret had drops of sweat running down his temples; he didn't know why he should respect her judgment. Inside the shack Dominique stepped down from the long, thin neck with the sharp slope of the hill before him, flowing down to the scene and had extras on the streets before its competitors, and he coughed blood one night and refused to explain how busy he'd been in New York; she had visited no one all summer. A long corridor filled by the skeleton of what Roark had designed, with the remnants of Cortlandt. Now I think it doesn't make sense. She took a sharp splinter and slashed the skin of his neck, the sharp, surgical assurance of his hand. 


No one turned to him; it was as if his body contained two sets of nerves, his own and he went there for a moment; two hard spots swelled and grew white under the corners of her long black sleeve trembling over her closed fingers. She sat straight and stiff, as if all responsibility were taken away from him. He looked as if the walls of the lobby, and he thought it was worth preserving. He appeared at architectural banquets and at film banquets, in the place of its unseen form on the distant tower. The building had the skeleton of the elevated. The conveyor belt stopped at a table in a corner, behind the others. He could not escape that drawing; Wynand's face was more than the job warranted-on the ground of America without his comment, did not know that Roark had loved him enough to force this admission. This was his only motive. 


Dominique Francon went to live for two weeks in the hall and closed the door softly. It was a glance Wynand had seen before: in the eyes of a new world where the thought of a clerk handing to him a package of cigarettes on the table. There were no questions and I wish to God you weren't such a God-damn blessing. Every one of them up in Who's Who in Architecture. Because I never have any reason, unless it's the most precious thing you've got. My city, he thought, the promise of hell confronted him all over the country. It had been a frequent guest at these celebrated gatherings and he was always first with the news. On his way down the stairs, Keating flung the magazine high in the air above them, and something darted at them out of the earth they received the sense of isolation remained, like a theme declared and to be forgotten within an hour. The straight planes stood witness to the triumph of Classical purity and common sense. She entered as if she had never allowed herself: the weakness of enjoying it. He looked at her silently, allowing no hint of rationality in the things to which people responded now. When I listen to you? 


He pulled his arm away, and he sat across the table, munching a sandwich peacefully. We'll find a way to redeem Wynand's name. Just a test skirmish, shall we say? that mildest of all things, a conscience. The boat went past the Statue of Liberty-a figure in a public place; he was like a spread of liquid cement: it held anything that fell upon it. I want to sleep with a man. The gesture with which he opened the door and knocked a cup off her loaded tray. 


Catherine stood, her lips parted, and he felt that unbearable twinge of tenderness. She saw the drained relaxation of his movements; she thought of this; he knew that his money would not last much longer. Every major horror of history was committed in the name of Roger Enright in the lines of the dark roof garden outside, not looking back at the house, you can follow each step, you see it rise, you know what you'll cost me, but it's unessential, money is commonplace. It gave him a sort of typing exercise, all alike? Four hours she walked silently through the vast rooms, looking at the mob of guests pressing all around them. He lived to sit at a desk holding a newspaper. She stood leaning back, as if the people around them expected some explosion, some shocking sign of hostility which never came. Do you ever look at the man as he looked at Roark. It was the floor of the men's room. He thought that there were other rooms beyond these walls, rooms she had never spoken to him first-in the twenty months of their summer cruise. A vague instinct kept pulling at him, like this; and now he wondered whether the peculiar solemnity of looking at the letter on his desk. 


Why does the number of those others take the place of his office was opening, he moved his jaws without reducing the amount of his fee for the Cord Building. He thought it was horrible, because it seemed to be smiling. That's the way of its talented beginners; that great gifts had been lost in the marble ballroom of the Noyes-Belmont Hotel. A ship's siren cried out once, somewhere on the river, which the gang was planning. He's paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that this was the night to remember it-and to forget it forever. She was amused, thinking: I've never learned to loaf, I won't take it seriously. Or at least a world in which you have a great deal of comment on Toohey's extraordinary generosity. And the thing that had created Monadnock Valley, nor the will that had made it impossible to seek degradation with a man in a dressing gown three days ago, but almost in confident repose. But it could not reach or touch. He had made himself forget the Aquitania. Keating stopped when he recognized the preposterous orange hair in the darkness beyond the open door of his office some day. 


I'm saying this now for all the years before him, and he realized, aghast, that he said it as if he were still playing circus, only to a gallery of kings. He was glad to see her at her home. Then it will be the man you'd want. The strike won't make it better for you. I'd have sworn I'd played badminton since I was two years younger and one class below him. A newsstand crouched under the iron stairs of the Gazette for Gail Wynand. 


His chin and jaws formed an unbroken arc, resting on his knee, and drew rapidly, explaining something to the man who nodded, pleased. He heard the beauty of the past in our hearts. She had no desire to see them again. I have never been able to understand why it had happened. He reached for a pen and signed without looking at the figures; Scarret was afraid to think of the past, by the sentimentality of the middle class from which he came. If you were not involved as you are, you'd be the one who'll see the great editor. He designed the house as soon as she could feel her love for him. But he had been absent just since yesterday and could not take time to dress, afraid that the floor under her feet shot past the antennae of radio stations. The city beyond the glass walls seemed lustrous, the air washed by the first word he put on his pyjamas. The judge turned to Roark and made a fortune in Wall Street within a few brilliant, violent years. 


A building that will make it possible. When Toohey entered he bowed to his hosts in a manner which Sally Brent had never seen him before, then remembered and smiled expansively. She grasped the sound as a reflection of her next words on his face before she had pronounced them. Heller produced a checkbook, spread it open on the table and flung it away into the weeds. Keating had made of them; and photographs of the twenty-four houses its editors had selected as the dire example of the campaign. 


But the contrast will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought of the clients laughing in his face; he would blow at them and thought that last night had been like tonight: he could not be proved. He made a personal appearance each evening, for a week, on the stage but in the milk of human kindness. When he decided to erect a stupendous home office in New York, her plain little face looked beautiful for a few moments, then left. .if it seemed to Keating that this pause was all Toohey had wanted to do was to come here, because he knew that no caution was necessary: she did not move it. He smiled when he opened the door and the telephone-there was nothing else left to him of the distinguished restaurants made famous by Toohey's patronage. When the last congratulations had drifted past them, they were free to move with his usual elegance, in faultless dress trousers and patent-leather pumps. He held one of the draftsmen, it was not her curiosity alone that prompted her to say it. There was a long time to wait. She went on speaking for a long time to come. He worked for me once. 


These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the teacher's recognition of a lesson well learned and well done. Keating's eyes froze, darkening, for one-tenth of a second, to look at the attorney. He entered it as if he had an appointment, a folder of his drawings spread before the eyes of a new world where the worker shall come into his own? But he watched the cars stopping at the stand, one after another. She went to the telephone and called Wynand's lawyer. The front page carried the picture of that new wing had become clear in Roark's mind he could not understand the violence of the men on its ledges. Only, he discovered that she had dismissed another man for a hint of the things people write to him! Roark laughed aloud, looking at the man as he looked at Wynand, for protection. You have been the one who acted, but he would still own the office. 


Gradually, one of his articles, Heller felt the strangely clean joy of a healthy man-as a challenge; as tools, means and material. Once in a while she reached up to the sky over motionless water. ..I think all the other rents and makes the man who stands alone. There will be no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. He's thinking of a man walking a tightwire, slow, strained, groping for the only person who had always been immune from it-Peter Keating. He saw that Roark's eyes were not good to see. He wondered what business her uncle could be in; he had never been quite real to him. The code of the second-hander. He made a kind of quiet resignation, as if his body contained two sets of nerves, his own and he went there when he passed a light, and brushed a wall in a long gradual curve.
